      "cough, all warn me that I must set my house in order, and make provision\n",
      "for your future.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "It was an apparently old man who spoke thus, and yet the years of his life\n",
      "numbered but a little over fifty.\n",
      "\n",
      "His hair was silvery white; his face was colorless and haggard, his eyes\n",
      "dim and sunken, and his form was much attenuated and bowed by the disease\n",
      "which was fast consuming him.\n",
      "\n",
      "He was sitting by a blazing fire, in an ordinary easy-chair over which a\n",
      "heavy coverlid had been thrown to make it more comfortable; but he\n",
      "shivered, and hovered over the blaze, as if he were chilled to the very\n",
      "marrow, while the hands which he held extended to catch the warmth were\n",
      "livid, and trembling from weakness.\n",
      "\n",
      "The room was small, but cozy and home-like. A cheap, coarse carpet, though\n",
      "of a bright and tasteful pattern, lay upon the floor. An oval table,\n",
      "covered with a daintily embroidered cloth, stood in the center. There was\n",
      "a pretty lamp, with a bright Japanese shade upon it. There were also a few\n",
      "books in choice bindings, and a dainty work-basket filled with implements\n",
      "for sewing. A few pictures--some done with pen and ink, others in crayon,\n",
      "but all showing great talent and nicety of execution--hung, in simple\n",
      "frames, upon the walls. The two windows of the apartment were screened by\n",
      "pretty curtains of spotless muslin over heavier hangings of crimson, while\n",
      "a lounge and two or three chairs completed the furnishing of the room.\n",

      "Beside the table, in a low rocker, several paces from the invalid by the\n",

      "there sat a young girl, with a piece of fancy work in her hands, upon\n",
      "which she had been busily engaged before her father spoke.\n",
      "\n",
      "She was perhaps twenty years of age, with a straight, perfect form, and a\n",
      "face that would have better graced a a palace than the humble mountain\n",
      "home where she now abode. It was a pure, oval, with delicate, beautiful\n",
      "brows; soft, round cheeks, in which a lovely pink came and went with every\n",
      "emotion. Her eyes were of a deep violet color, shaded by dark silken\n",
      "lashes, though their expression was saddened somewhat just now by a look\n",
      "of care and anxiety. Her white forehead was surmounted by rich\n",
      "chestnut-brown hair, which was gathered into a graceful knot at the back\n",
      "of her finely shaped head. A straight, patrician nose; a small, but rather\n",
      "resolute mouth, and a rounded chin, in which there was a bewitching\n",
      "dimple; small, lady-like hands and feet, completed the <i>tout ensemble</i> of\n",
      "Virginia Abbot, the daughter and only child of a whilom honored and\n",
      "wealthy bank president of San Francisco.\n",
      "\n",
      "When addressed, as recorded above, the beautiful girl had started and\n",
      "grown suddenly pale, and a look of keenest pain shot into her violet eyes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then her sweet mouth straightened itself into a stern, resolute line.\n",
      "There was a moment of solemn silence, which she broke, by saying, in a\n",
      "repressed but gentle tone:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I am sorry that you are feeling worse than usual to-night, papa. I know\n",
      "you must be weary. You are always that after being all day in the mine,\n",
      "and the storm, of course, aggravates your cough; but if you will rest a\n",
      "few days you will surely be better.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, Virgie, it is useless to build upon false hopes. I shall never be any\n",

      "decided to dispose of it to the first one who will offer me a fair price\n",
      "for it. But, dear child, if it were not for you I believe I should be glad\n",
      "to know that my saddened life is almost at an end. I----\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The weary voice quivered and failed here, and the man sank back in his\n",
      "chair with a bitter sigh.\n",
      "\n",
      "The young girl, her own face now blanched to the hue of death, laid down\n",
      "her work, arose, and moved swiftly to her father's side, where she knelt\n",
      "by his chair.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Papa, do not talk so. You must not leave me,\" she cried, in a voice of\n",
      "agony. \"I cannot spare you. There must be something to help you--to build\n",
      "up your strength. Let us go back home, where you can have the best medical\n",
      "advice.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The man sat up in his chair, stopping her with a gesture almost of\n",
      "despair.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Home!\" he cried, hoarsely. \"Virgie, we have no home but this. You know\n",
      "that I am already the same as dead to every one but you; that even our\n",
      "real name is sunk in oblivion.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But, papa, you must try to live for my sake,\" Virgie cried, clasping her\n",
      "trembling hands about his emaciated arm, and shuddering as she felt how\n",
      "frail it was. \"If you will not go back, let me at least send for Dr.\n",
      "Truel. He is skillful. He was always our friend. He will cheer you and\n",
      "give you something to build you up, and he will keep our secret, too. Oh,\n",
      "you ought to have had advice long ago. What shall I do in this dreary\n",
      "place if you leave me alone?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The sick man unclasped her clinging hands from his arm, and drew her\n",
      "slight form to him in a tender embrace.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"My darling,\" he said, fondly, \"that is just what I wish to talk with you\n",
      "about; so calm yourself and listen to me. Neither Dr. Truel, nor any other\n",
      "doctor, can help me now; if I had called him a year ago he might have\n",
      "prolonged my life; but my pride would not let me face any one whom I had\n",
      "ever known. But I will not speak of the past; it is too familiar and\n",
      "painful to both of us. It is useless, however, for me to think for a\n",
      "moment of going back, even to die, in the home where we were once so\n",
      "happy, for only disgrace is connected with our name--disgrace and wrong,\n",
      "all the more keenly felt because unmerited.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Hush, Virgie!\" he continued, as a shuddering sob burst from the breast\n",
      "pressed so closely to his, \"you must not give way so. I did not mean to\n",
      "alarm you unnecessarily by what I have said; I may not leave you for some\n",
      "time yet. I may be spared for a few months, perhaps until autumn, but I\n",
      "feel that the time has come to arrange some definite plan for your future.\n",
      "I must, however, give up my work, for I have no longer strength to carry\n",
      "it on; but if there was only some one whom I could trust to take charge\n",
      "of my claim. I might even yet reap something of benefit from it to add to\n",
      "the hoard that I have been saving for you against this emergency.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But, papa, I would much rather that you should spend every dollar that\n",
      "you have, if it would prolong your life; if I lose you, I have not a\n",
      "friend in the world.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The man heaved a heavy sigh, for too well he realized the truth of her\n",
      "words.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"My dear,\" he returned, with tender pathos, \"if it were possible for me to\n",

      "But I know that it cannot be, and my care now must be to make the best\n",
      "provision that I can for you.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I have been very successful since coming here,\" he went on, speaking more\n",
      "cheerfully, \"more so than I ever dared to hope, and the claim promises\n",
      "much for the future and ought to bring a good price if sold; so you will\n",
      "have quite a snug little fortune, my Virgie, and I trust that your lot in\n",
      "life will yet be happy, in spite of the dark cloud that has so shadowed it\n",
      "in the beginning. What say you to writing to my old friend, Laurence\n",
      "Bancroft, of New York, confiding you to his care after----\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, my father, you make me utterly wretched,\" cried the young girl,\n",
      "reaching up her arms and clasping them convulsively about his neck, while\n",
      "she lifted her tear-stained face appealingly to him.\n",
      "\n",
      "He bent forward and kissed her white forehead softly with his trembling\n",
      "lips.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Bear with me a little longer, my daughter, and then we will never mention\n",
      "this again while I live,\" he returned, huskily. \"Laurence Bancroft, as you\n",

      "two daughters about your own age; he will believe me when I tell him the\n",
      "truth regarding our misfortunes, and will, no doubt, give you a home in\n",
      "his own family, and care for your interests until--woman's best gift--the\n",
      "love of some true man comes to you, and you have a home of your own. New\n",
      "York is almost on the other side of the world, and no evil breath of the\n",
      "past will be likely to touch you there. What do you say, Virgie?--may I\n",
      "write to my friend, giving you to his care?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, papa,\" Virgie said, wearily assenting to his project, more to put an\n",
      "end to the painful conversation than because she had any choice in the\n",
      "matter, \"you may do whatever your judgment tells you is best, and I will\n",
      "be guided entirely by your wishes.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Abbot looked intensely relieved.\n",
      "\n",
      "This question had troubled him for many months, and he had always shrunk\n",
      "from speaking of it, because of the pain which he knew it would inflict.\n",
      "With this vital matter settled, he felt that he could give up all care,\n",
      "and spend the few remaining days of his life in peace with his idolized\n",
      "child, and calmly await the end, which he knew was so near.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That is right, dear,\" he said, with a contented smile. \"I am greatly\n",
      "comforted. I will write a full account of everything, together with my\n",
      "wishes for your future, and it will be ready to be sent to Mr. Bancroft at\n",
      "a moment's warning. I do not care to have him know anything about us just\n",
      "yet; hark! what was that?\" he broke off abruptly, and started into a\n",
      "listening attitude.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Only the wind and the storm beating against the house, I think,\" answered\n",
      "Virgie, lifting her head, and calmed for the moment as she, too, listened\n",
      "to what had seemed an unusual noise.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It is a wild night, my child. I hope no one is homeless in this storm,\"\n",
      "said Mr. Abbot. \"I am thankful for this peaceful, though humble refuge,\n",
      "after the turmoil and wrong of a few years ago, only it is hard for you to\n",
      "be so shut away and isolated from those of your own age. But surely that\n",
      "was a knock, Virgie.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The young girl started to her feet as a loud and imperative rap echoed\n",
      "through the small entry outside the parlor.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was seldom that they were disturbed at that hour of the evening, for\n",
      "among the hard working people of the mining district in which they lived,\n",
      "there were few who were not early wrapped in slumber after the labors of\n",
      "the day.\n",
      "\n",
      "Virgie passed quickly out of the cheerful parlor into the tiny hall, and\n",
      "opened the outer door, though the heavy burglar chain was fastened and\n",
      "would admit of its being opened but a little ways.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Who is there?\" she asked, in her clear, sweet tones.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"A stranger who has lost his way and seeks direction to the nearest public\n",
      "inn,\" answered a rich, mellow voice from without.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Abbot now came out, a heavy shawl wrapped about his shoulders to\n",
      "shield him from the dampness.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It is more than a mile from here, and a very poor place at that,\" he\n",
      "said.\n",
      "\n",
      "The stranger outside gave a low whistle of dismay at this information, and\n",
      "muttered something about being in \"a very uncomfortable fix.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Abbot unfastened the chain, threw wide the door, and invited the\n",
      "unknown to come in out of the storm.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Thanks,\" was the courteous response; \"but I will not trespass upon your\n",
      "hospitality if you will kindly direct me to the inn of which you speak.\n",
      "The darkness came on so suddenly that I lost my way. I left Oreana at\n",
      "noon to go to Humboldt, but my horse sprained his foot on the rough\n",
      "mountain road, and I have had to come at a snail's pace ever since.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You are sadly out of your way, indeed, if you are going to Humboldt, for\n",
      "it is a good ten miles from here. Come in--come in out of the pouring\n",
      "rain, and we will discuss what will be best for you to do,\" returned his\n",
      "host, in a hearty tone, for he was won by the man's frankness and\n",
      "courtesy.\n",
      "\n",
      "The stranger stepped, dripping, into the hall, a tall, straight figure,\n",
      "booted and spurred, and enveloped in waterproof jacket, trousers, and\n",
      "havelock.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Thanks,\" he said, \"you are very kind; but allow me to introduce myself;\n",
      "my name is Heath--William Heath, at your service.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Then, Mr. Heath, come to my fireside and dry and warm yourself; my name\n",
      "is Abbot and this is my daughter,\" replied Mr. Abbot, leading the way into\n",
      "the cheerful parlor whither Virgie had retired when her father opened the\n",
      "door to the benighted wayfarer.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Heath bowed with all the polish that could have been expected of him\n",
      "had he been in a royal drawing-room instead of a rude cottage in a ruder\n",
      "mining district of the mountains of Nevada, while his dark eyes flashed\n",
      "with a look of admiration over the perfect figure and into the lovely face\n",
      "of his host's daughter.\n",
      "\n",
      "He removed his hat and havelock, revealing a grand head covered with\n",
      "waving brown hair, and a handsome face all aglow with intelligence. His\n",
      "eyes were a dark, wine-brown, his glance as keen and straight as an\n",
      "eagle's, his manner and bearing betraying that he was accustomed to mingle\n",
      "with people of culture and refinement.\n",

      "\n",
      "Virginia Abbot simply inclined her regal head in returning the stranger's\n",
      "greeting; then taking up her work again, she sat down by the table, with\n",
      "her back toward the fire and the newcomer. She had not failed to notice\n",
      "his look of surprised admiration when introduced to her, and it had\n",
      "affected her strangely.\n",
      "\n",
      "Five years previous Mr. Abbot and his young daughter had come to that wild\n",
      "region entire strangers--the former, a man of gentlemanly bearing,\n",
      "somewhat past his prime; the latter a wondrously beautiful girl of\n",
      "fifteen, just budding into womanhood, and with a dignity of mien and\n",
      "refinement of speech which, together with her beauty, caused the uncouth\n",
      "inhabitants of the place to regard her with something of awe, and as if\n",
      "they thought she belonged to an entirely different sphere from them.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Abbot owned a claim in the gold and silver region there, which he\n",
      "asserted that he was going to work himself, much to the surprise of the\n",
      "rough miners, for he was a frail looking man.\n",
      "\n",
      "He built a small but very convenient house, containing five rooms, which,\n",
      "with the few elegancies he had brought with him, for his child's sake, and\n",
      "which proclaimed that the strangers had been accustomed to the luxuries of\n",
      "life heretofore, became the pride and wonder of the settlement.\n",
      "\n",
      "The house was painted inside and out; there were carpets upon the floors,\n",
      "draperies at the windows, vases and ornaments on the mantels, pictures on\n",
      "the walls. But though all the furnishings were of the simplest and\n",
      "cheapest, yet, to the rude and unaccustomed people about them, their home\n",
      "seemed a veritable palace.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another mystery and evidence of superiority was the grave and\n",
      "self-contained Chinaman who came with them, and was installed as cook and\n",
      "servant in general in the small kitchen, and who waited upon the young\n",
      "lady of the house with so much respect and deference.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here the father and daughter lived in the utmost seclusion. Virgie never\n",
      "was seen outside her home unless accompanied by her father or servant, and\n",
      "Mr. Abbot, when not in the mine, devoted himself wholly to his child.\n",
      "\n",
      "They made no friends, and did not mingle at all with those about them,\n",
      "although they were always kind and courteous to every one, and thus won\n",
      "the respect of every man, woman and child in the hamlet. Mr. Abbot had the\n",
      "appearance of being much broken in spirit; his countenance wore a look of\n",
      "habitual sadness, and his abundant hair, so prematurely whitened, plainly\n",
      "told that some heavy trouble had overtaken him in the past. Nothing could\n",
      "be learned of their antecedents, where they had lived, or why they were\n",
      "there, though Chi Lu, the servant, was often plied with questions by the\n",
      "curious, and thus they were regarded as a trio of very mysterious\n",
      "personages.\n",
      "\n",
      "After a year or so, it began to be whispered about that \"the governor,\" as\n",
      "Mr. Abbot was called, because of the respect in which he was held, had\n",
      "\"struck it rich,\" in other words, that his claim was proving an unusually\n",
      "fruitful one, and he was making money rapidly. How this came to be known\n",
      "it would be hard to say, for he was very uncommunicative, going and coming\n",
      "to and from his work quietly and unostentatiously, and living in the\n",
      "simplest manner.\n",
      "\n",
      "As time passed, Virginia Abbot grew even more beautiful than she was when\n",
      "she had first come to her mountain home. The bracing air agreed with her,\n",
      "her health was perfect, while her simple manner of living and her regular\n",
      "habits were calculated to develop to the utmost every charm, and keep her\n",
      "strong, and fresh, and beautiful.\n",
      "\n",
      "Her mind was not allowed to lie dormant, however, for her father attended\n",
      "most carefully and faithfully to her education, and not only insisted upon\n",
      "a regular and thorough course of study, but kept her well provided with\n",
      "the literature of the times, embracing many new books and various papers\n",
      "and periodicals.\n",
      "\n",
      "But for more than a year past, Mr. Abbot's health had been failing. The\n",
      "change, however, was so gradual that Virgie did not observe it until the\n",
      "disease had fastened itself so firmly upon him that he was beyond all\n",
      "human aid. The man himself fought against it for months, striving to\n",
      "prolong his life for the sake of his idolized daughter, although,\n",
      "personally, the world had no longer any charms for him; but it never\n",
      "relaxed its fatal hold, and at last, at the time of the opening of our\n",
      "story, he felt that the time had come for him to give up labor and lay\n",
      "down all burdens, for he knew that his days were numbered.\n",
      "\n",
      "The question of providing a home and protection for Virgie had long\n",
      "agitated his mind.\n",
      "\n",
      "They had no relations or friends to whom he could confide her. There were\n",
      "reasons why he was unwilling to appoint a guardian and send her back to\n",
      "their former home, and so, at last, he resolved to commit her to the care\n",
      "of his early friend and college mate, Laurence Bancroft, a wealthy\n",
      "merchant of New York city.\n",
      "\n",
      "But the matter was to be taken entirely out of his hands, and the\n",
      "beautiful girl's destiny settled in a way wholly unexpected by either\n",
      "father or daughter.\n",

      "       *       *       *       *       *\n",
      "\n",
      "When Mr. Heath, the benighted and storm-delayed traveler, threw back his\n",
      "dripping coat, and seated himself at the invitation of his host, before\n",
      "the blazing fire, Mr. Abbot thought that he had seldom seen a more\n",
      "attractive young man.\n",
      "\n",
      "He was apparently about twenty-five years of age. His dark eyer were full\n",
      "of intelligence, and fringed with long silken lashes. His features were\n",
      "clear cut, as if they had been chiseled in marble. A dark brown moustache\n",
      "shaded, but did not conceal, a sensitive mouth, from which there flashed\n",
      "the gleam of brilliant teeth whenever he spoke or smiled; his nose was\n",
      "well formed, and his smooth, rather massive chin betrayed strength of\n",
      "purpose and decision of character.\n",
      "\n",
      "His address was very courteous, even fascinating, and his voice possessed\n",
      "a rich, mellow tone, with a sympathetic ring in it, to which it was a\n",
      "delight to listen, and which won at once upon the hearts and confidence of\n",
      "his entertainers.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You are unfortunate to be obliged to traverse our rough mountain roads on\n",
      "such a night as this,\" Mr. Abbot observed, with a shiver, as he drew\n",
      "nearer the fire, and laid another heavy oaken stick across the glowing\n",
      "blaze.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That is true, sir,\" responded his guest, yet the glance, which he\n",
      "involuntarily shot at Virgie, bending gracefully over her work, did not\n",
      "betray an overwhelming sense of his misfortune.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I Am On My Way To Join A Party Of Sportsmen At Humboldt,\" He Continued. \"I\n",
      "Was Detained At Virginia City Upon A Matter Of Business, And They Went On\n",
      "Before, Promising To Wait There For Me Until To-Morrow Evening.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Are you traveling on horseback?\" Mr. Abbot asked, with some surprise.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, sir; but the train on which I started met with an accident this\n",
      "morning, which was liable to detain it several hours, and being impatient\n",
      "of the delay, I procured a horse at Oreana, thinking I could easily reach\n",
      "Humboldt by evening, when I could return it by rail. But the unfortunate\n",
      "beast sprained his foot on a rolling stone, as I have already told you;\n",
      "the storm and darkness overtook me, I lost my way, and my courage was just\n",
      "about failing, when I espied the friendly lights of this settlement, and I\n",
      "resolved to stop at the first house I came to and ask where I could find\n",
      "shelter for the night.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Abbot had been studying the young man's face attentively during this\n",
      "explanation.\n",
      "\n",
      "He liked his appearance exceedingly; his countenance was honest and true,\n",
      "his story straightforward and well told, and some unaccountable impulse\n",
      "prompted him to take measures to become better acquainted with him.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"If you are going to Humboldt, you should have taken the turn to your left\n",
      "five miles back on the mountain,\" he said. \"It would be impossible for you\n",
      "to reach it to-night, even if you could be set right, for you would be\n",
      "sure to lose your way again in the darkness. The only public house--if you\n",
      "can call it such--in this region, is at least a mile from here, and far\n",
      "from inviting or comfortable at that; so allow me, Mr. Heath, to offer\n",
      "you the hospitality of our home for the night, and to-morrow you can start\n",
      "afresh and refreshed upon your way.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The young man looked up with a glance of surprise, while a quick flush\n",
      "mounted to his brow, at this unexpected and rather extraordinary offer,\n",
      "for he well knew that in a mining district all strangers are regarded with\n",
      "suspicion if not with positive dislike.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Sir, you are very kind,\" he began, casting another glance toward the\n",
      "lovely maiden by the table, for he had seen her give a quick start at her\n",
      "father's invitation, \"but I fear I should trespass beyond all bounds were\n",
      "I to accept your offer.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, indeed,\" returned Mr. Abbot, with more of eagerness in his manner\n",
      "than he was in the habit of betraying over anything. \"I could not think of\n",
      "allowing you to go on in this driving storm, and we can arrange it very\n",
      "comfortably can we not, Virgie?\" turning toward her.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, sir,\" was the low though unhesitating reply.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But I am an entire stranger to you. How dare you take me into your\n",
      "household? How do you know but that I am a robber or a brigand in\n",
      "disguise?\" queried Mr. Heath, with a twinkle in his fine eyes. But still\n",
      "he was strongly tempted to accept the friendly offer, not only on account\n",
      "of the comfort surrounding him, but because he was attracted by the\n",
      "cultivated gentleman and his charming daughter, both of whom were a great\n",
      "surprise to him, finding them as he had in that wild region.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Nay,\" responded Mr. Abbot, smiling, yet meeting the frank eyes of his\n",
      "guest steadily, \"I think I can vouch for your character as a gentleman\n",
      "even though you are an utter stranger. Remove your wet garments, I pray,\n",
      "and make yourself comfortable for the night.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But my horse,\" began Mr. Heath, suddenly bethinking himself of the\n",
      "dripping and suffering animal.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"True. Pardon my thoughtlessness,\" returned his host, adding, \"There is a\n",
      "small shed attached to our dwelling where he can at least be sheltered.\n",
      "Virgie, please go and send Chi Lu to assist Mr. Heath.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Virgie immediately arose and left the room, and soon after a diminutive\n",
      "Chinaman appeared in the doorway, bearing a lighted lantern, and\n",
      "signifying his readiness to \"puttee up te hossee.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Heath left the house with him, and both were gone some time, attending\n",
      "to the animal's injured leg and trying to make him as comfortable as\n",
      "circumstances would allow.\n",
      "\n",
      "During their absence Virgie, at the suggestion of her father, busied\n",
      "herself in arranging a supper for the storm-beaten traveler, who upon his\n",
      "return was greeted by the fumes of steaming coffee, while an appetizing\n",
      "array of cold meats and other viands was spread upon the table, which had\n",
      "been drawn up before the fire.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I fear Miss Abbot is making herself trouble on my account,\" Mr. Heath\n",
      "remarked, with a swift and grateful glance at the graceful form and\n",
      "flushed face that was bending over the glowing coals, where the young girl\n",
      "was toasting to a delicate brown a slice from a wheaten loaf.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, indeed; it is no trouble; and a meal after your long ride in the rain\n",
      "will not come amiss,\" Virgie answered, looking up and meeting his fine\n",
      "eyes for an instant.\n",
      "\n",
      "She deposited the bread upon a plate, and inviting the young man to be\n",
      "seated, poured with her own hands a cup of fragrant coffee, which she\n",
      "placed before him.\n",
      "\n",
      "She continued to wait upon him with exquisite ease and grace until his\n",
      "hunger was appeased, which was not soon, for it was a rare pleasure for\n",
      "him to watch her beautiful and expressive face while he chatted with her\n",
      "father, sipped his coffee, and ate his toast.\n",
      "\n",
      "But he finished at length, and then Chi Lu was summoned the table cleared,\n",
      "and the room restored to its usual order.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Abbot seldom had met a real gentleman since coming among the\n",
      "mountains; he had lived chiefly within himself and for his child. But now\n",
      "he found that he had not lost all interest in the outside world, and he\n",
      "enjoyed immensely Mr. Heath's account of his travels, and his descriptions\n",
      "of men and things.\n",
      "\n",
      "Virgie had not seen her father so bright and animated in all the five\n",
      "years of their secluded life, and she began to hope that his fears\n",
      "regarding his failing health were groundless after all. She, too, enjoyed\n",
      "the young stranger's conversation, although she did not join in it. She\n",
      "sat by, with her dainty embroidery in her hands, listening, and showing by\n",
      "her expressive face and shining eyes how rare a pleasure such congenial\n",
      "society was to her.\n",
      "\n",
      "But by and by she stole away to her own room, where she lay far into the\n",
      "night thinking of the handsome stranger--of his eager yet respectful\n",
      "glances when he looked at her; of the low, rich cadence of his voice when\n",
      "he spoke to her, and feeling that she should miss him more than she had\n",
      "ever yet missed anyone during the last five years, when he should go away\n",
      "on the morrow.\n",
      "\n",
      "The two men talked some time longer after Virgie left; the Chi Lu was\n",
      "called again, the pretty lounge was converted into a comfortable bed, and\n",
      "Mr. Heath was told that the parlor was at his service for the night.\n",
      "\n",
      "The young man was very thankful for the hearty hospitality of which he had\n",
      "been the recipient, and felt that he had been extremely fortunate in\n",
      "finding such a pleasant abiding-place; but, although he was very weary\n",
      "from his rough and tedious ride over the mountain, he found that slumber\n",
      "was hard to woo, and he, too, lay awake for long hours, wondering over the\n",
      "strange experience of the evening, and what hard fate--for hard he felt\n",
      "sure it must have been--could have driven a cultivated gentleman like Mr.\n",
      "Abbot, and his peerless daughter, who was so well fitted to shine in the\n",
      "most brilliant circles of the world, away from the haunts of civilization\n",

      "The next morning broke fair and beautiful.\n",
      "\n",
      "Every trace of the storm had passed away, save that the dust was laid and\n",
      "all nature looked fresher and brighter for the copious bath it had\n",
      "received.\n",
      "\n",
      "Virgie Abbot, despite her sleeplessness during the first half of the\n",
      "night, was up at an early hour, superintending breakfast for her father\n",
      "and their guest.\n",
      "\n",
      "If she had been lovely the previous evening she was doubly so now in her\n",
      "pretty flannel wrapper--for the mornings were chilly in that region, even\n",
      "in the summer The wrapper was of a light blue tint, wonderfully becoming\n",
      "to her delicate complexion, and harmonized well with her eyes and the\n",
      "dainty pink in her cheeks.\n",
      "\n",
      "Her face wore a brighter, more eager look, than was its wont, this\n",
      "morning, and she was full of life and energy that was born of her youth\n",
      "and sunny, hopeful temperament.\n",
      "\n",
      "The incidents of the previous evening had been a pleasant break in her\n",
      "hitherto monotonous life, and she was now looking forward, with no small\n",
      "degree of interest, to meeting by daylight the handsome stranger who had\n",
      "taken refuge with them.\n",
      "\n",
      "During all the years that she had been in that rude place she had not seen\n",
      "one real gentleman, excepting her father; they had never before\n",
      "entertained a visitor, and there had been nothing but her reading and\n",
      "studies, her drawing and fancy work, to vary the quiet, almost dull\n",
      "uniformity of her existence.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Abbot himself looked brighter and better as he came out from his\n",
      "chamber and gave Virgie his usual morning greeting and caress.\n",
      "\n",
      "This visit had evidently done him good also, and Virgie took \"heart of\n",
      "grace\" from the fact, and put aside, for the time at least, the anxious\n",
      "fears that had so burdened her the night before.\n",
      "\n",
      "Breakfast was served in the simple but clean and cheerful kitchen which\n",
      "led from the parlor, while the small table, laid for three, had almost an\n",
      "air of elegance, with its spotless cloth, its few pieces of silver, china,\n",
      "and cut glass, relics of former glory, and the tiny vase of flowers, with\n",
      "the dew and rain still on them, which Virgie had gathered from the edge of\n",
      "the cliff near by.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Heath's glance expressed something of surprise as it swiftly took in\n",
      "these appointments; but to him the fairest sight of all was the slim but\n",
      "perfect figure of the young girl who sat at the head of the table, and\n",
      "poured his coffee, and waited upon him with all the ease and\n",
      "self-possession of one who had been long accustomed to the formalities and\n",
      "etiquette of high life.\n",
      "\n",
      "The young man wondered at it. There was no other woman in the house, nor\n",
      "had been since they came there, for Mr. Abbot had mentioned that he lost\n",
      "his wife more than six years ago; but this girl was a perfect little\n",
      "hostess, and dainty, to the last degree, in her person. Her hands were\n",
      "white and delicate, the pretty pink nails without a blemish; her hair\n",
      "soft and silken, showing a careful wielding of the brush; her linen collar\n",
      "and cuffs were immaculate, her handkerchief white as snow, and fine and\n",
      "sheer, while everything about her bespoke lady-like refinement and a high\n",
      "regard for nicety of toilet.\n",
      "\n",
      "He could hardly keep his eyes off her, she was so fair a picture; but once\n",
      "or twice she had looked up and caught his glance, flushed, and fearing to\n",
      "embarrass her, he turned resolutely to his host and opened a subject upon\n",
      "which he had been thinking quite, seriously.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I understood you to say last evening, I believe, sir, that you were\n",
      "desirous of disposing of your claim,\" he remarked.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes; my health is too poor to admit of my working it any longer, and I\n",
      "should be glad to dispose of it to the right person,\" Mr. Abbot replied.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I think I know of some one who would like it, if it is still a promising\n",
      "one,\" the young man said, but a conscious color flushed his cheek slightly\n",
      "as he felt Virgie's eyes turned upon him.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I honestly believe that it is richer to-day than when I began to work\n",
      "it,\" Mr. Abbot asserted confidently. \"However,\" he added, \"I do not ask\n",
      "you to take my word for it. If you know a party who would like to\n",
      "purchase, tell him to bring an expert and examine for himself; and even\n",
      "then if he is not satisfied to buy outright, he may work it upon shares\n",
      "until he is convinced of its value.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That is fair, I am sure,\" said Mr. Heath.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Perhaps you would like to take a look at it before you go?\" suggested\n",
      "his host, who was eager to dispose of his property.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I would, I assure you,\" was the reply; \"but there is hardly time this\n",
      "morning, for I feel that I must join my party immediately, else they will\n",
      "be anxious regarding my safety. We are bound upon an excursion through the\n",
      "northern portion of the State, and intend to be absent a week or more; but\n",
      "after that, if you will permit me, I will return here and investigate\n",
      "matters--that is, if you will give me the refusal of the claim until\n",
      "then.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "As the young man said this, his glance involuntarily wandered again to the\n",
      "beautiful face of Virgie.\n",
      "\n",
      "There must have been something magnetic in his gaze, for she raised her\n",
      "white lids just then, and met the earnest, wistful look bent upon her.\n",
      "\n",
      "A flush leaped to her cheek, and her violet eyes dropped instantly upon\n",
      "her plate again, while her heart fluttered like a caged wild bird.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I will gladly wait your time, Mr. Heath,\" Mr. Abbot responded, in a\n",
      "satisfied tone. \"I begin to think that your losing your way and falling to\n",
      "our care last evening was providential.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I have no doubt of it, sir,\" was the grave and reverent reply. \"I believe\n",
      "that all our ways are ordered for us; that everything is arranged for us\n",
      "by an All-wise Power.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Something very like a sneer curled the almost colorless lips of his host\n",
      "at this unexpected assertion.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Abbot was no believer in the individuality of God, and had spoken both\n",
      "lightly and at random when he had referred to the young man's visit as\n",
      "being providential.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What do you mean by an All-wise Power?\" he asked, skeptically.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I mean God, sir.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You believe there is a God, then?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Certainly; do you not?\" and Mr. Heath's kind, grave eyes looked pityingly\n",
      "into the haggard, sunken face before him.\n",
      "\n",
      "They seemed almost to say, \"If you have not this belief to comfort you,\n",
      "with the hand of death laid upon your very heart, I grieve inexpressibly\n",
      "for you.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"If there is, I imagine He must allow Satan to have the control of some of\n",
      "our lives,\" was the evasive and bitter retort. \"Virgie, Mr. Heath's cup is\n",
      "empty.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "But his face flushed and his hands trembled as he thus abruptly turned the\n",
      "topic, showing how deeply the subject moved him; notwithstanding his\n",
      "pretended unbelief.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Thanks; no more coffee for me,\" Mr. Heath said, with a smile and a bow to\n",
      "his young hostess, as she offered to replenish his cup; but he noticed\n",
      "that there was a troubled, anxious look in her eyes as they rested upon\n",
      "her father.\n",
      "\n",
      "He made no reply to Mr. Abbot's remark, although he looked a trifle hurt.\n",
      "\n",
      "He simply said, as he folded his napkin and pushed back his plate:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I must ask you to excuse me and my lack of ceremony if I bid you good\n",
      "morning, and take French leave. I feel that I ought to get on my way as\n",
      "soon as possible; and believe me I am very grateful for your hospitality\n",
      "and courtesy.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Virgie arose as he spoke, and like the true little lady that she was,\n",
      "assured him that it had been a delight to entertain him, and she should\n",
      "look forward with pleasure to his return.\n",
      "\n",
      "He thanked her, shook hands warmly with her, and then left the house,\n",
      "followed by Mr. Abbot, who watched him depart with a feeling of regret\n",
      "such as he had not experienced over any one during all the years of his\n",
      "exile.\n",
      "\n",
      "Still he pleasantly anticipated his coming again, when he meant to make\n",
      "him remain several days.\n",
      "\n",
      "He had been strangely attracted toward him from the moment when he had\n",
      "first heard his mellow, sympathetic tones, asking to be directed to a\n",
      "place of shelter. He knew that he possessed a grand character, for he\n",
      "carried the stamp of true nobility upon his frank, handsome face.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That is a promising young man, Virgie,\" he said, as he returned to the\n",
      "parlor after watching the horse and its rider disappear down the mountain.\n",
      "\"I should like to know where he came from, and more about him.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Virgie did not reply, but she turned away from the window where she, too,\n",
      "had been watching the receding horseman, with a shy, sweet smile on her\n",
      "red lips. William Heath's last glance had been for her, as he doffed his\n",
      "hat and bowed low in his saddle when he turned down the road.\n",
      "\n",
      "During all the week that followed her step was lighter and her face\n",
      "brighter than its wont, and she went singing about the house to the\n",
      "delight of her father, who was now at home all the day long, as he had\n",
      "given up going to the mine.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Abbot had appeared very thoughtful after the departure of his young\n",
      "guest, often falling into a profound reverie, in which he would sit for\n",
      "hours.\n",
      "\n",
      "Virgie often wondered what he could be thinking about, but she did not\n",
      "feel like questioning him, lest he should refer again to the painful topic\n",
      "of his leaving her.\n",
      "\n",
      "One day, however, coming into the room suddenly, she saw her mother's\n",
      "bible in his hands, and she was sure there were tears in his eyes. She\n",
      "appeared not to notice either his employment or his emotion, but soon\n",
      "stole softly away again, and went weeping up to her own room.\n",
      "\n",
      "After that he busied himself with writing a great deal, and she felt sure\n",
      "that he was making arrangements for her of which he had spoken on that\n",
      "stormy evening. A great dread came over her at the thought of being left\n",
      "alone in the world; and yet, in spite of all, she looked forward to the\n",
      "return of Mr. Heath with more of pleasure and anticipation than she had\n",
      "known for many a year.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thus more than a week went by, and one afternoon Virgie, her father being\n",
      "asleep and the house oppressively still, took her book and went out to a\n",
      "little nook back of her cottage, where she was in the habit of going to\n",
      "study, and where Chi Lu had built a rustic seat for her beneath a great\n",
      "pine tree that grew out of a cleft in the mountain.\n",
      "\n",
      "But she could not concentrate her thoughts upon the page before her; they\n",
      "went roving after a coal black steed and its handsome rider, until finally\n",
      "her book dropped from her hands, her eyes fixed themselves dreamily upon\n",
      "the lofty, far-off peaks of the Humboldt Mountains, and she was lost to\n",
      "time and place--everything save her own delightful musings.\n",
      "\n",
      "So absorbed was she that she was not aware of the approach of any one\n",
      "until a small but exquisitely arranged bouquet of mountain flowers were\n",
      "laid upon the seat beside her, and a rich but well remembered voice said:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Pardon me, Miss Abbot, for intruding upon your solitude, but Chi Lu told\n",
      "me that Mr. Abbot was resting and could not be disturbed at present, and\n",
      "that I should find you here.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Virginia sprang to her feet, the tint of the wild rose in her cheeks, her\n",
      "violet eyes grown black with repressed excitement.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Mr. Heath?\" she cried, her scarlet lips parting in a bewildering smile.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes; forgive me for having startled you so,\" he said, gently, then adding\n",
      "with a twinkle of amusement in his eyes. \"You were surely in a very brown\n",
      "study.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I am afraid I was,\" she returned, laughing. \"But what lovely flowers!\"\n",
      "she continued, taking them up and bending to inhale their fragrance. \"How\n",
      "kind of you to gather them for me.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The young man's eyes lingered about her in a delighted gaze, for she made\n",
      "the fairest picture imaginable standing there in her soft gray dress with\n",
      "its collar and cuffs of black velvet, a knot of scarlet ribbon at her\n",
      "throat, the brilliant flowers in her hands, and a fleecy white shawl\n",
      "wrapped about her shoulders. Her shining hair was gathered into a satiny\n",
      "brown coil at the back of her head and pinned with a silver arrow, while a\n",
      "few naturally curling locks lay lightly on her forehead. The dark,\n",
      "moss-grown rock was behind her; the softly waving plumy boughs of the\n",
      "pine tree above her, a carpet of tender green beneath her feet.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You are still trembling from the shock that I have given you,\" he said in\n",
      "a tone of self-reproach, and noticing how the flowers quivered in her\n",
      "grasp, \"pray, pardon me and give me a handshake of welcome, or I shall\n",
      "almost regret that I came.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "She looked up frankly into his dark eyes, and laid her small hand\n",
      "unhesitatingly in his.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You are very welcome, Mr. Heath,\" she said, \"and I am sure that papa will\n",
      "be very glad to see you.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "William Heath smiled at her words.\n",
      "\n",
      "He felt sure that she, too, was glad to see him--that his coming was a\n",
      "pleasant break in the monotony of her life; her varying color, the bright,\n",
      "happy gleam of her eyes told him this.\n",
      "\n",
      "Her wonderful beauty, so out of place in that wild region, thrilled him\n",
      "strangely. Her queenly manner, her delicacy and refinement astonished him,\n",
      "and he wondered more and more what mysterious circumstances could have\n",
      "combined to drive two such cultivated people so far from civilization to\n",
      "hide themselves in the rugged fastnesses of those dreary mountains.\n",

      "\n",
      "A Mountain Ramble.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You were reading,\" he remarked, stooping to pick up the book that had\n",
      "fallen to the ground as she arose. \"Tacitus!\" he added, in a tone of\n",
      "astonishment, as his eye fell upon the title page.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, I am reviewing; papa likes me to study a little every day, still,\"\n",
      "Virgie returned, quietly, while she examined her flowers with a critical\n",
      "eye, and wondered that a gentleman could have arranged them so well.\n",
      "\n",
      "He must be an artist, she thought, for no one save an artist, or a lover\n",
      "of art, could have taken such pains to harmonize colors like that.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I should suppose you would labor under serious difficulties in trying to\n",
      "pursue your studies in such a place as this,\" Mr. Heath remarked.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, no, papa is a fine scholar, and he makes a most delightful teacher.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And have you pursued a regular course under him?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, partly. I left school when I was fifteen, but I have kept right on\n",
      "the same as I should have done if I had remained, and I graduated two\n",
      "years ago,\" she concluded, smiling archly at the idea of graduating in\n",
      "that wild country.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And with high honors, of course,\" said her companion in the same vein.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Certainly; with all the honors, since there was no one to compete with\n",
      "me or to bear away the palm from me. But, Mr. Heath, you must be both\n",
      "weary and hungry after your ride over the mountains; come in, and let me\n",
      "get you a lunch,\" Virgie concluded, on hospitable thoughts intent.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, indeed, thank you; I will eat nothing until tea time, when, if you\n",
      "will permit me, I will gladly join you. I should much prefer to sit here\n",
      "and enjoy this magnificent view with you to going indoors.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He seated himself, as he spoke, upon the rustic seat, and Virgie,\n",
      "following his example, they fell into a pleasant chat, which lasted more\n",
      "than an hour.\n",
      "\n",
      "Virgie never forgot that delicious hour, neither did her companion, who\n",
      "was every moment growing more deeply interested in the beautiful mountain\n",
      "maiden.\n",
      "\n",
      "He talked upon many themes, and was surprised to find how fluently she\n",
      "could converse with him, showing how much and how thoroughly she had read,\n",
      "and how wisely and carefully her father had superintended her education.\n",
      "She was far above the average woman in point of intellect and culture, he\n",
      "told himself and it was a pity that her life should be wasted in that\n",
      "wretched place.\n",
      "\n",
      "But they were at length interrupted by Chi Lu, who came to tell them that\n",
      "Mr. Abbot was awake, and had asked for them.\n",
      "\n",
      "They immediately arose to go to him, and found him sitting upon the tiny\n",
      "porch in front of the cottage.\n",
      "\n",
      "He was looking thinner and more worn, Mr. Heath thought, than when he had\n",
      "last seen him, and his cough was far from troublesome, even though the\n",
      "weather was milder. It was evident, to him, at least, that the man was in\n",
      "the last stages of consumption, and could not live many months, if weeks,\n",
      "although, as the weather grew warmer, he might rally somewhat.\n",
      "\n",
      "He greeted the young man warmly, and made many inquiries regarding his\n",
      "trip and the success which he and his party had met with in their sport.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Very good,\" Mr. Heath told him, adding, \"And now my friends have gone to\n",
      "Salt Lake City, while I have retraced my steps hither to talk with you\n",
      "about that claim of yours.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Virgie looked up quickly at this, a lovely flush rising to her cheek. If\n",
      "only he would become its purchaser.\n",
      "\n",
      "The eyes of the two young people met, and held each other in a glance that\n",
      "sent the blood coursing more rapidly than usual through their veins.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Abbot's face, brightened.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Then you still think that you know some one who will purchase it?\" he\n",
      "said, eagerly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, sir--if--if it proves all that you have described it, I think I may\n",
      "like to buy it myself,\" Mr. Heath answered quietly, but with rising color.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You! you don't look like a person who would care to take to mining for a\n",
      "living,\" returned his host, in a surprised tone.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I might say the same of you, sir,\" said the young man, smiling.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Abbot flushed, and for a moment appeared considerably agitated and\n",
      "unable to speak.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then he said, with something of hauteur in his manner:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Sometimes a person is compelled by circumstances, over which he has no\n",
      "control, to adopt a pursuit, which under other conditions he would shun as\n",
      "both unfitting and obnoxious.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I beg your pardon, Mr. Abbot,\" Mr. Heath hastened to say, in a\n",
      "deprecatory tone. \"I had no intention of calling to mind anything of an\n",
      "unpleasant nature; my reply was lightly and thoughtlessly given. However,\n",
      "I have always had a desire to see something of mining, and although I may\n",
      "not attempt to work at it myself, I think I should like to own a claim.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Very well; then to-morrow I will show you over the premises; and explain\n",
      "all that you may wish to know; perhaps, though you may not be quite so\n",
      "much in favor of a miner's life when you come to realize the difficulties\n",
      "attending it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Chi Lu now interrupted with the information that tea was ready, and Mr.\n",
      "Abbot repeated the invitation that Virgie had already given to their new\n",
      "friend, insisting further, that he should remain their guest until he\n",
      "should decide regarding the purchase of the claim.\n",
      "\n",
      "Upon being assured that it would inconvenience the household in no way, he\n",
      "consented, nothing loath at the prospect of being allowed to bask in\n",
      "Virgie's presence, and to have an opportunity to study her character more\n",
      "fully.\n",
      "\n",
      "After tea, which was really a dainty meal, far better and more acceptably\n",
      "served than any the young traveler had eaten since leaving San Francisco\n",
      "three weeks previous, Mr. Heath, seeing that Mr. Abbot was weary and more\n",
      "inclined to rest upon the lounge than to converse, asked Virgie if she\n",
      "would allow him to be her escort and go out for a ramble.\n",
      "\n",
      "The young girl flushed with pleasure at the request, and cordially\n",
      "assented.\n",
      "\n",
      "She wrapped her fleecy shawl once more about her shoulders, and tying a\n",
      "dainty hat--which Chi Lu's skillful fingers had woven from mountain\n",
      "grasses, and her own fair hands had trimmed--upon her pretty brown head,\n",
      "they sauntered forth.\n",
      "\n",
      "The sun had gone down, but the western sky was all ablaze with crimson and\n",
      "orange, which gradually faded into soft purple and deeper blue in the\n",
      "upper sky. There were mountains all about them, some darkly green with\n",
      "fir, spruce, and pine, others of brighter and tenderer tints in their\n",
      "dress of oak, maple, and birch, while here and there arose one bald and\n",
      "gray, all of solid rock, with now and then a patch of moss clinging to its\n",
      "time worn sides, but giving variety to the scene and enhancing by contrast\n",
      "the whole picture.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Where would you like to go?\" Virgie asked, as they passed out of the\n",
      "little gate into the rough road.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Wherever you will take me,\" Mr. Heath replied, as he looked smilingly\n",
      "down into the beautiful face upraised to his.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Then I will take you up to the Bare Ledge; the finest view can be\n",
      "obtained from there,\" the girl replied as she moved on to hide the blush\n",
      "which his look had called to her face.\n",
      "\n",
      "It moved her strangely whenever she met the gaze of the grand man, for\n",
      "grand her soul told her he was, with that magnificent head, that\n",
      "intelligent face, and that quiet, yet high-bred dignity of manner which\n",
      "she had never seen in any other save her father.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The Bear Ledge?\" repeated Mr. Heath. \"Why is it called that? Is it\n",
      "haunted by wild beasts? If it is, I shall certainly object to your going\n",
      "there.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, no; it is not that kind of a bear at all,\" laughed Virgie, the\n",
      "silver ripple of amusement breaking like music upon the evening air. \"It\n",
      "is called so because it is a mass of rock entirely barren; nothing will\n",
      "grow upon it; it seems to be the one spot in all this region that is\n",
      "absolutely desolate, and yet from it you may view a world of beauty.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "On they went up the mountain, conversing now upon one topic, now upon\n",
      "another, yet both conscious of but one prominent fact--that they were\n",
      "together, and supremely happy in each other's society.\n",
      "\n",
      "At last, however, their climb was over, and following a rough path that\n",
      "led along the side of the mountain for some distance, they at length came\n",
      "out upon a broad ledge or table rock, which was indeed barren to\n",
      "desolation.\n",
      "\n",
      "But the vista that opened out before them was beautiful beyond\n",
      "description.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mountains everywhere--above, below, and on either hand; but between them\n",
      "were fertile little valleys, with here and there glittering lakes with\n",
      "tiny streamlets trickling into them, that seemed like silver brooches and\n",
      "chains garnishing nature's emerald vestments.\n",
      "\n",
      "The youthful couple stood wrapt in silence for several minutes, viewing\n",
      "the varied landscape. To Virgie the scene was familiar as an oft-repeated\n",
      "tale, and yet she was never weary of it. To her companion it was one of\n",
      "the loveliest views that he had ever gazed upon, even though he had\n",
      "visited many lands and climbed many a mountain.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It is grand!\" said Mr. Heath, at last.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It is grand!\" echoed Virgie, drawing in a deep breath of pure air, and\n",
      "sweeping a delighted glance over all the fair scene.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I thank you very much for bringing me here,\" her companion continued. \"I\n",
      "would hardly have believed there could be such an exquisite view in this\n",
      "region; my disagreeable ride, when I came here before, rather prejudiced\n",
      "me against the locality. Do you come here often?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I used to, before papa's health failed him,\" Virgie answered, with a\n",
      "regretful sigh, as she remembered how little her father had been able to\n",
      "go about of late. \"We used to come here almost every Sabbath in fine\n",
      "weather, with our books and papers, and spend half the day--it is all the\n",
      "church we have had--and I shall always love the spot.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No doubt you do, and yet----\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Virgie looked up inquiringly as he paused abruptly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I was thinking,\" he continued, in reply to her glance, \"that this\n",
      "mountain must be a wild and lonely place for one like you to spend your\n",
      "life in.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, it is lonely,\" the young girl responded, with a wistful gleam in her\n",
      "violent eyes.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Have you lived here long, Miss Abbot?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Five years--a little more.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"So long? Surely you cannot have had much congenial society,\" Mr. Heath\n",
      "remarked, as he contemplated with no favoring eye the rude hamlet far\n",
      "below them on their right.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"None, save my father.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And have you never been lonely, and yearned for youthful companionship?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, yes, often,\" and the bright tears sprang quickly into Virgie's blue\n",
      "eyes, as she thought of the nights she had wept herself to sleep from\n",
      "sheer homesickness and a feeling of utter desolation. \"But,\" she continued\n",
      "more brightly, and winking rapidly to keep the tell-tale drops from\n",
      "falling. \"I can bear loneliness, or almost anything else, for my father's\n",
      "sake.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Poor child! brave little woman!\" thought the man by her side, \"it must\n",
      "have been very much like being buried alive, and she has borne it like a\n",
      "heroine; but she will not have to endure it much longer 'for her father.'\n",
      "I wonder what will become of her when he is gone.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Mr. Abbot seems very feeble,\" he said aloud, \"do you not think a change\n",
      "would be beneficial to him?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I--do not know,\" Virgie began wistfully; then added, more to herself than\n",
      "to him, \"Where could we go?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I would advise the sea-shore. I should think the salt air would do him\n",
      "good. Santa Cruz, Monterey, or any of those places on the California\n",
      "coast, would be both pleasant and healthful.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "A startled look came into Virgie's eyes, and her face grew pale.\n",
      "\n",
      "She had often been to Santa Cruz and Monterey, in the old delightful days\n",
      "when her mother was living, where she had reigned like a little queen, and\n",
      "they had all been so happy, with no suspicion of the black shadow that was\n",
      "creeping upon them so surely.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, no, we could not go there; I--I do not believe that papa could be\n",
      "persuaded to leave home,\" she faltered with evident nervousness and\n",
      "embarrassment.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"There is a sad history and a secret here,\" said Mr. Heath to himself, and\n",
      "he wondered more than ever what cruel misfortune could have driven these\n",
      "people thus into exile.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Has Mr. Abbot ever consulted a physician?\" he asked.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No; there is no physician near us. But papa understands something of\n",
      "medicine himself,\" Virgie answered, sighing, for her heart was very heavy\n",
      "whenever she thought of her father's condition, and it was evident to her\n",
      "that Mr. Heath considered him to be in a very critical state.\n",
      "\n",
      "He saw that it troubled her to talk about it, and resolved that he would\n",
      "not refer to the subject again.\n",
      "\n",
      "As they stood there the gorgeous tints faded out of the western sky, a\n",
      "purplish haze settled over mountain and valley, like a gauzy vail\n",
      "softening all their outlines, and a mist was beginning to rise from the\n",
      "depths below.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The dew is falling, Miss Abbot. I fear you will take cold in this\n",
      "dampness. Shall I take you back now?\" Mr. Heath asked.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes. I think it will be hardly safe for us to linger longer,\" she\n",
      "replied. \"But, Mr. Heath, be careful as you go down; the path is not\n",
      "altogether safe.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The young man laughed lightly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I have scaled greater heights, climbed steeper and more rugged paths than\n",
      "these, Miss Abbot,\" he said. \"The Alps, the Pyrenees, the Caucasus, are\n",
      "all familiar ground, and this is but child's play compared with them.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, then you have been in Europe?\" Virgie cried, with animation.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, in almost every portion of it,\" he answered, watching her kindly\n",
      "face with admiration.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"How favored you are,\" she sighed wistfully. \"I have longed with a mighty\n",
      "longing to visit foreign lands.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Have you? Perhaps some time your wish may be gratified. I hope it may\n",
      "be,\" he returned, in an earnest tone. \"Now give me your hand, and let me\n",
      "assist you down this slippery path.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, no. Please care for yourself, Mr. Heath, and let me follow you,\" the\n",
      "young girl pleaded. \"I know every step of the way, and it is all strange\n",
      "to you.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "But he stood still in the way, with his hand outstretched to her, resolute\n",
      "yet smiling. He would not yield his point, and without another word she\n",
      "laid her own within his, and together they went down the mountain path, he\n",
      "guiding her steps as carefully as if she had never been over the ground\n",
      "before, and she finding it very pleasant to be so shielded and attended.\n",
      "\n",
      "When they reached more level ground he drew the hand he held within his\n",
      "arm, and they slowly wended their way back in the gloaming to the cottage,\n",
      "Virgie feeling strangely light-hearted and happy, and almost as if a new\n",
      "and beautiful life was about opening before her, while William Heath, with\n",
      "a twinkle of amusement in his fine eyes, wondered what his aristocratic\n",
      "mother and sister would say; what another brilliantly beautiful woman\n",
      "would think to see him thus playing the devoted cavalier to this simple\n",
      "and unpretending mountain maiden whom he thought so lovely.\n",
      "\n",
      "He had at that moment in his pocket, letters from two of them, begging him\n",
      "to \"quit his wanderings,\" to \"come home and settle down to the real\n",
      "business of life. The property needed his care, and--Sadie had not been\n",
      "like herself since his departure.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "These words came to him now, but they did not change in the least the\n",
      "purposes that were taking root in his mind--the determination to remain in\n",
      "that isolated hamlet as long as <i>Virginia Abbot's father should live</i>.\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The next morning Mr. Abbot and his young guest visited the mine, and,\n",
      "after a thorough examination of the former's claim, and instituting some\n",
      "inquiries, more for form's sake than anything else, regarding the wealth\n",
      "of the mine generally, Mr. Heath became the purchaser of Mr. Abbot's\n",
      "property, and at once set about hiring competent miners to work it for\n",
      "him.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It may prove but a foolish, quixotic undertaking after all,\" he told\n",
      "himself, when his negotiations were completed, \"but I must have some\n",
      "excuse for remaining here. That girl is the most beautiful being I ever\n",
      "met. She has power to move me as I was never moved before. I simply\n",
      "<i>cannot</i> go away and leave her. I am sure her father can live but a little\n",
      "while, and then--\"\n",
      "\n",
      "What was to happen after Mr. Abbot should be taken away remained unsaid,\n",
      "and Mr. Heath walked on for a while with bent head and thoughtful brow.\n",
      "\n",
      "He was looking about him a little to find a place in which to live while\n",
      "he should remain on the mountain, for he was resolved that he would\n",
      "trespass upon Mr. Abbot's hospitality no longer than he was obliged to,\n",
      "although every hour in Virgie's presence was perfect delight to him.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I would give a good deal to know their history,\" he resumed, after a\n",
      "little. \"It is the greatest mystery--their being here. The man shows\n",
      "culture and familiarity with men and things; he is unusually keen and\n",
      "shrewd in business matters, while the way he has managed his daughter's\n",
      "education betrays the scholar and a mind of no ordinary power and ability;\n",
      "and to be <i>here</i>, working with the common herd in a <i>mine!</i> I do not\n",
      "understand it!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "While he was speculating thus regarding his new friends, Mr. Abbot and\n",
      "Virgie were engaged in the same manner with reference to him.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, Virgie, I have sold my claim, and for a generous sum, too. Mr.\n",
      "Heath is no haggler, and gave me my price without a demur; but I think\n",
      "that it is very queer that a young man of his stamp should care to engage\n",
      "in any such business.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It is rather strange,\" Virgie admitted, absently.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"He is far above the people with whom he will come in contact,\" continued\n",
      "her father. \"He has evidently been accustomed to the very best of society,\n",
      "is well educated and fine appearing, and seems to have an abundance of\n",
      "means. What do you make of him, dear?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I should say that he is very much of a gentleman, papa,\" replied the\n",
      "young girl, flushing, as she remembered their walk of the previous\n",
      "evening, the care and attention which he had bestowed upon her, and the\n",
      "delight which she had experienced in his presence.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, that goes without saying; but, does he seem like an American to\n",
      "you?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I had not given a thought to his nationality,\" Virgie answered, looking\n",
      "up curiously.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, it strikes me that he may be English, although there is nothing in\n",
      "his speech or manner to betray it. He is built like an Englishman, and\n",
      "somehow the idea has taken possession of me that he belongs over the\n",
      "water, and so, his desire to settle here seems all the more\n",
      "incomprehensible.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It may be a whim--a romantic desire to learn something of a miner's\n",
      "life,\" observed Virgie; \"or,\" with more animation, \"he may be an author,\n",
      "papa, and is taking this way to study certain phases of character with\n",
      "reference to writing a book.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, Virgie,\" said Mr. Abbot, smiling, \"I must confess that is the most\n",
      "reasonable explanation that could suggest itself, and possibly, with your\n",
      "woman's intuition, you have hit upon the right solution of the mystery.\n",
      "Yes,\" after a thoughtful pause, \"I shouldn't wonder if you were right. His\n",
      "saying that he did not intend to work the mine himself goes to show that\n",
      "it is a secondary object, and he does not care particularly about the\n",
      "profit of it. He is very pleasant company. I believe his coming has done\n",
      "me good.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I am sure it has,\" Virgie answered, brightly; \"and papa, now that your\n",
      "mind is relieved of all pecuniary care, don't you think you will continue\n",
      "to improve?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, Virgie,\" her father returned, gravely; \"do not allow my temporary\n",
      "improvement to deceive you. A fatal disease has fastened itself upon me,\n",
      "and I know that I have not long to live.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, papa!\" exclaimed the lovely girl, sharply. \"I will not believe it.\n",
      "Pray, <i>pray</i> try what medical advice will do for you.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Hush, my child,\" Mr. Abbot returned, deeply moved. \"I did not mean to\n",
      "refer to this again, but you force me to do so; nothing short of a miracle\n",
      "could give me a sound pair of lungs again.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Then let us try change of air--anything so that I may keep you with me,\"\n",
      "Virgie pleaded, yet knowing, as she did so, that there was no place on\n",
      "earth that held so much attraction for her now as the humble home which\n",
      "heretofore had seemed so lonely and isolated.\n",
      "\n",
      "A subtle charm seemed suddenly to have fallen upon it; everything looked\n",
      "brighter; all things surrounding it had become dearer.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, dear; no air will be so good for me as this pure, bracing mountain\n",
      "atmosphere,\" her father replied, gently. \"I would shrink from going to any\n",
      "place where we should be likely to find familiar faces--nothing would\n",
      "break me down so quickly. Be patient, Virgie for a little longer, and then\n",
      "<i>you</i> shall go back to the world, where you ought long ago to have been\n",
      "with people of your own age.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, papa! I care nothing for the world nor for society without you,\" she\n",
      "sobbed, realizing more fully than she ever had done, that she would soon\n",
      "be fatherless.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But it is not right that you should spend your life in such a place as\n",
      "this,\" responded Mr. Abbot. \"I have written to Mr. Bancroft, and if\n",
      "anything happens to me suddenly you will find the letter in my desk, and\n",
      "must send it to him immediately. I would mail it now, only--I cannot feel\n",
      "reconciled to having any one learn of our hiding-place while I live. One\n",
      "thing more I must speak of. I should have done so the other night if we\n",
      "had not been interrupted. When I am gone I want you to lay my body here,\n",
      "under the shadow of the old pine tree.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Papa, papa! you will break my heart! Surely you would wish to lie beside\n",
      "my mother!\" Virgie cried, the tears raining over her cheeks.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Abbot's face was almost convulsed with pain for a moment.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, if that were possible,\" he said, at length, \"but no one must ever\n",
      "know the fate of Abbot Al--Ha! Virgie, I had nearly uttered the dishonored\n",
      "name!\" he panted.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Papa, you shall not talk so,\" the girl cried, wiping her tears and\n",
      "turning on him almost indignantly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I would not pain you, my darling,\" he answered, gently; \"but if there\n",
      "were no cloud hanging over us, I should be only too glad to go back to our\n",
      "old home to die and be laid beside my loved ones. It cannot be, however,\"\n",
      "he concluded, sighing wearily.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But, dear papa, the dreadful past was caused by no fault of your own, and\n",
      "it is not right that you should suffer as if it had been,\" Virgie said,\n",
      "passionately.\n",
      "\n",
      "A cynical smile curled the lips of the sick man.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The world would tell a far different story if it should ferret out my\n",
      "grave and see my name blazoned above it; and as long as its poisonous\n",
      "tongues continue to speak slightingly of me, it must never know aught\n",
      "about me. So do as I bid you; promise that you will obey me, Virgie.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "And the almost broken-hearted girl promised, but feeling as if it would be\n",
      "almost more than she could bear, to go back to the gay world, where she\n",
      "would be kindly cared for and sheltered, and leave her dear father lying\n",
      "in his lonely grave upon that desolate mountain.\n",
      "\n",
      "William Heath entered with great apparent interest upon his mining\n",
      "operations, and although he frankly acknowledged his entire ignorance of\n",
      "the business, exhibited a goodly amount of judgment and common sense which\n",
      "warned the workmen whom he had hired that it would not be well for them to\n",
      "attempt to take advantage of him.\n",

      "caused a small cabin to be erected just opposite Mr. Abbot's dwelling,\n",
      "furnished it simply but comfortably from the nearest supply station, and\n",
      "with Mr. Abbot's permission, contracted with Chi Lu to keep his table\n",
      "supplied with all needful provisions.\n",
      "\n",
      "No one would have supposed from his humble surroundings from the\n",
      "industrious and energetic life which he led, and the total absence of\n",
      "anything like arrogance or assumption, that he belonged to an almost royal\n",
      "family, and had been for years the petted darling of fashionable circles\n",
      "and drawing rooms, the catch of many seasons, and the prize for which fond\n",

      "\n",
      "But such was the fact, and William Heath had thus isolated himself from\n",
      "his home and all that he held most dear simply because, while on a\n",

      "touch a chord in his heart that had never vibrated before.\n",
      "\n",
      "These two young people were now thrown almost daily into each other's\n",

      "\n",
      "Mr. Heath was quite literary in his tastes, and after the duties of the\n",
      "day were over he invariably sought the companionship of Virgie, sometimes\n",
      "reading to her while she worked, and often with her as she still\n",
      "persisted in reviewing certain studies and authors which she loved.\n",
      "\n",
      "The failing invalid, too, received much of his care and attention, while\n",
      "many delicacies, which he had never taken pains to procure for himself,\n",

      "\n",
      "It is easy to see whither all this tended.\n",
      "\n",
      "Virgie soon learned to look for Heath's coming, to listen for his\n",
      "footsteps and the sound of his voice, as she had never looked for or\n",
      "listened to anything else in the world before. She began to rely upon him,\n",
      "to experience a sense of restfulness and content in his care that\n",
      "sometimes made her wonder how she had ever been able to live without him.\n",
      "\n",
      "There came new beauty, and light, and earnestness into her face, a\n",
      "tenderer smile to her red lips, a more musical cadence into her voice. The\n",
      "hours dragged heavily without him, and they took to themselves wings when\n",
      "he came.\n",
      "\n",
      "Before she realized the fact she had learned to love him with all the\n",
      "strength of her nature, and her destiny was sealed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thus weeks and months went by.\n",
      "\n",
      "For a time the warm, genial summer weather seemed to hold Mr. Abbot's\n",
      "disease somewhat in check, and, as he was cheerful, and enjoyed the\n",
      "novelty of having two young and charming people about him, there was a\n",
      "little season during which that small household was very happy.\n",
      "\n",
      "He studied the young stranger attentively, and was more and more\n",
      "prepossessed in his favor. They conversed frequently upon topics which Mr.\n",
      "Abbot had long been in the habit of scoffing at, but there was an element\n",
      "of reverence in Mr. Heath's nature that commanded his respect in spite of\n",
      "preconceived ideas and a tendency to skepticism. His arguments were always\n",
      "reasonable and convincing. He could not fail to feel this influence; and\n",
      "it was not long before Virgie could see that a great change had taken\n",
      "place in her father's feelings regarding his relations to an overruling\n",
      "power and the future, which hitherto had seemed so vague and uncertain.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yet, notwithstanding all this, he often experienced a feeling of\n",
      "uneasiness.\n",
      "\n",
      "He could not fail to perceive that Virgie was learning to care a great\n",
      "deal for their new friend, and that Mr. Heath was deeply interested in his\n",
      "daughter.\n",
      "\n",
      "This was all well enough if Mr. Heath was what he appeared to be, and his\n",
      "intentions were honorable.\n",
      "\n",
      "But he could never quite divest himself of the feeling that there was\n",
      "something rather mysterious in his desire to remain in that remote region,\n",
      "and it would be terrible if any harm should result from it to his one ewe\n",
      "lamb.\n",
      "\n",
      "He had always guarded her so tenderly and carefully no breath of evil,\n",
      "scarce a sorrow, save their one great sorrow, had ever touched her. Once\n",
      "or twice the thought had come to him, prompted, no doubt, by the\n",
      "circumstances which had driven him to that place, that the man might have\n",
      "become entangled in some wrong or crime, and was hiding, like himself,\n",
      "from the world and justice; and yet it was difficult to fancy that he was\n",
      "not all that was honorable and upright, for his life and conduct from day\n",
      "to day were beyond reproach.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"If they love each other, and he is all he seems, I could give her to\n",

      "while brooding upon the subject one afternoon while Virgie and her lover\n",
      "were out on a ramble. \"She would be far better off under the care and\n",
      "protection of a kind husband, than she would be to send her to New York.\n",

      "\n",

      "she will have money, and he is seeking her for that, it would be a fearful\n",
      "blow. I could not bear that her young life should be ruined.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He sat in troubled thought for a long time, considering the subject from\n",
      "every point, sometimes reproaching himself for not having foreseen the\n",
      "danger of allowing the two young people to come together, and refused to\n",
      "sell his claim to Mr. Heath; then again feeling a sense of shame for his\n",
      "unworthy suspicions of one who bore the stamp of true nobility upon his\n",
      "very face.\n",
      "\n",
      "At length he was aroused from his reverie by the sound of the voice he\n",

      "resolution, he said:\n",
      "\n",

      "where her father was sitting, and all unconscious of the very serious\n",
      "considerations that were agitating his mind: \"I have invited Mr. Heath to\n",
      "take tea with us. A basket of the loveliest peaches came to us this\n",
      "afternoon from some mysterious source, which, however, I am inclined to\n",
      "think, he could tell us something about if he chose. So, if you entertain\n",
      "him for a little while, I will go and prepare a dish of them for him to\n",
      "share with us.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, yes. Come in, Mr. Heath. I was waiting to see you. Run away, Virgie,\n",
      "and attend to your peaches, and I will see that our friend is properly\n",
      "entertained until tea is ready,\" the invalid responded, with unusual\n",
      "animation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Virgie tripped lightly up to her chamber, where she removed her hat, and\n",
      "stopped a moment before her glass to rearrange the locks that lay lightly\n",
      "upon her forehead, and blushed a conscious rosy red as she looked into her\n",
      "eyes and read the strangely happy expression that lay in their clear\n",
      "depths. Then she tied a long white apron around her slim waist, and went\n",
      "down to pare her peaches, never suspecting the vital questions that were\n",
      "being discussed in the little parlor so near her.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Mr. Heath,\" Mr. Abbot began, as the young man had seated himself, \"I was\n",
      "thinking of you just as you entered, and had resolved to ask you a couple\n",
      "of very plain, and to me, important questions.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Which, no doubt, I shall be very glad to answer if I can do so,\" his\n",
      "companion responded, smiling, yet flushing lightly as he began to suspect\n",
      "what the nature of the invalid's inquiries might be.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Thank you,\" responded Mr. Abbot, courteously, and then added, gravely: \"I\n",
      "do not need to remind you, I am sure, that as a father I am often anxious\n",
      "regarding my daughter's future, and for this reason I feel compelled to\n",
      "ask you that which, under other circumstances I should not feel at liberty\n",
      "to ask. Will you tell me who you are?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"My name, Mr. Abbot, is--William Heath,\" the young man began, looking\n",
      "thoughtful; then seemed to hesitate to go on.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Is that all that you have to tell me about yourself?\" the invalid\n",
      "inquired, with some dignity, and attentively studying the face opposite\n",
      "him. \"I knew that before,\" he went on, a suspicion of sarcasm in his tone,\n",
      "\"but I have long felt that there was something of mystery connected with\n",
      "the circumstances of your being here. It is rather extraordinary that a\n",
      "young man of your talent and culture should desire to locate in a rough\n",
      "place like this. It has been evident to me for some time that your mining\n",
      "operations were of secondary importance to you, for you cannot reap much\n",
      "if any profit. It must take nearly all you realize to pay the two men you\n",
      "hire to work your claim, while you lead, comparatively, a life of leisure.\n",
      "My second question was regarding this--why are you here?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "William Heath lifted his frank, dark eyes, and looked straight into the\n",
      "face of his host, and said, in a low tone, but with an earnestness which\n",
      "betrayed that he felt he had much at stake:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Mr. Abbot, I will answer your last question first, as frankly as you have\n",
      "asked it, though, no doubt, you will be greatly surprised, and perhaps\n",
      "startled, by my reply. I am here simply and solely to try and win Virginia\n",
      "Abbot for my wife.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Abbot sat erect, looking astonished indeed at this astounding\n",
      "statement, and a spot of deep red settled in each hollow cheek.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What can you mean? You never saw her until three months ago!\" he said,\n",
      "excitedly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"True, I never saw her until that wild, stormy night when I came to you a\n",
      "weary, dripping traveler and you so kindly extended to me your\n",
      "hospitality. But I began to love your daughter that very evening. I do not\n",
      "need to tell you that she is beautiful, for you know it; but to me she\n",
      "seemed the fairest woman that I had ever seen; her presence moved me as I\n",
      "had never been moved before, and I felt as if I could hardly go on to join\n",
      "my friends and leave her. But I suddenly found a pretext for returning\n",
      "when you mentioned that you desired to dispose of your claim. I resolved\n",
      "that I would become the purchaser. I would come here and remain to study\n",
      "the character of your daughter, and if she proved all that I fancied her,\n",
      "I would strive to win her for my wife. This, my dear sir, is why I am\n",
      "here; and now--will you give her to me?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Have you said anything to Virgie about this?\" Mr. Abbot asked, looking\n",
      "very grave.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, sir; I have not breathed a word of my intentions to her; but I\n",
      "accepted her invitation to tea this evening with the determination to tell\n",
      "you this, if I could make the opportunity, and ask your sanction to my\n",
      "suit before speaking to her.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Abbot looked gratified.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That was honorable of you,\" he said. \"It meets my estimate of your\n",
      "character.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Thank you, sir,\" Mr. Heath returned, flushing slightly, then continued:\n",
      "\"I am not given much to rhapsody or extravagances of language, but I know\n",
      "that I can never be a happy man unless I win Virgie, and if you will give\n",
      "her to me, I promise most solemnly to devote my life to her happiness.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Is William Heath your true name?\" Mr. Abbot questioned, determined to\n",
      "know all about him before committing himself.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, sir. I hope you do not think I have been masquerading under a false\n",
      "name,\" returned the young man, a quick flush mantling his cheek.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Pardon me; but you must remember that I could not account for your being\n",
      "here, and--and I was a little suspicious, I own, that you were not quite\n",
      "what you pretended to be,\" said the invalid, apologetically, and yet\n",
      "regarding him keenly.\n",
      "\n",
      "The flush on William Heath's face deepened. He looked very thoughtful for\n",
      "a moment, then said:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Mr. Abbot, you have read between the lines better than I thought. I would\n",
      "have preferred to remain plain William Heath to every one until after I\n",
      "had won my love; but perhaps I had better be perfectly frank with you. I\n",
      "am not an American.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I thought so,\" returned his companion, quietly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Did you?\" asked the young man, looking surprised. \"I compliment you upon\n",
      "your penetration then, for I have passed for one of your countrymen almost\n",
      "everywhere since coming to this country.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I think you are an Englishman,\" said Mr. Abbot.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I am, sir. I have an estate called Heathdale in the county of Hampshire,\n",
      "England. I own another in Surrey. Mr. Abbot, I am an English baronet, and\n",
      "I have simply been a visitor and traveler in this country during the last\n",
      "year.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You, an English baronet!\" exclaimed Mr. Abbot, excitedly, a vivid flush\n",
      "suffusing his face, then quickly receding, leaving him deadly pale.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, sir; but, pray believe me, I had no intention of boasting of either\n",
      "my wealth or title,\" observed the young man modestly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh!\" sighed the sick man. \"I am afraid then that you can never marry\n",
      "Virgie.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Sir! Why not? What is there in what I have told you to debar me from\n",
      "making your daughter my wife? I should suppose you would feel that I have\n",
      "it in my power to make her all the happier on account of it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But you do not know, you cannot understand, you English are so proud, so\n",
      "tenacious of honor and caste. Ah, my poor child!\" Mr. Abbot cried,\n",
      "incoherently, and appearing greatly agitated and distressed.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I am sure, my friend, I cannot comprehend this excessive emotion,\" Sir\n",
      "William--as we shall call him henceforth--remarked.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Would you be willing to marry a woman whose name is irretrievably linked\n",
      "with disgrace?\" Mr. Abbot asked, while cold perspiration started out upon\n",
      "his forehead, and his face was almost convulsed with his anguish of mind.\n",
      "\n",
      "He knew that Virgie had grown to love this man. He was conscious of the\n",
      "pride and prejudices of the English aristocracy, and he believed that when\n",
      "he should tell the story of his life, as he knew it was only right he\n",
      "should do, Sir William Heath would no longer care to make his daughter his\n",
      "wife, and her heart would be broken.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sir William looked up, startled at this question, his own face paling\n",
      "suddenly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Surely, Mr. Abbot, you cannot mean anything so bad as that,\" he replied,\n",
      "in a low, pained tone.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I will tell you all about it,\" said the sick man, \"and then you must\n",
      "decide for yourself whether you are still willing to wed the daughter of a\n",
      "dishonored man. Of course you have seen from the beginning of your\n",
      "acquaintance with us that no pleasure or profit that might accrue to us\n",
      "from this kind of a life could ever reconcile us to it; that only some\n",
      "terrible misfortune could have driven me and my beautiful darling into\n",
      "such a wild and desolate region as this.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes; I have felt that there was something mysterious in your being\n",
      "here--some secret reason why you should have shut yourselves away from all\n",
      "comfort and civilization,\" Sir William admitted, as his companion paused\n",
      "for strength to go on. \"But I have never attributed it to any willful\n",
      "wrong on your part.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Thank you for your faith in me,\" returned Mr. Abbot, gratefully. \"I only\n",
      "wish the world at large was as charitable; if it had been, I need not have\n",
      "been here now, on the verge of the grave, nor been obliged to doom my\n",
      "lonely child to a life of exile, when everything should be at the\n",
      "brightest for her; neither should we have been obliged to disown a name\n",
      "which, until recently had always been an honored and respected one\".\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Then your name is not Abbot,\" said Sir William.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, but that is not the whole of it; I will, however, confide that to\n",
      "you later. But of course I tell you this in strictest confidence; whatever\n",
      "your decision may be after you hear my story, I charge you not to betray\n",
      "me to any one.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You may trust me,\" said the young man, quietly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Then draw your chair closer, for not even Virgie knows the very worst,\n",
      "and I would not make her burden any heavier when there is no need.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The young baronet did as he was requested, but he looked both troubled and\n",
      "pale, for he knew not how this story might affect his future prospects. He\n",
      "was not different from his kind in some points; he belonged to an old and\n",
      "honored family; no shadow had ever tarnished their fair fame; he was proud\n",
      "and tenacious of honor, and his heart was heavy with apprehension as he\n",
      "thought that he might be about to hear some story of crime or wrong that\n",
      "would forever separate him from the woman whom he had learned to idolize.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Abbot leaned nearer his companion, and in a low voice gave him a brief\n",
      "and rapid account of his life and the adverse fate that had served to\n",
      "banish him to the sparsely populated mountains of Nevada. It was a\n",
      "strange, sad story of sin, and wrong, and shame, in which a complication\n",
      "of evidence and circumstances had permitted the real offender to escape\n",
      "justice and another to suffer the consequences of his crime.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sir William Heath never once moved or spoke during its recital, but his\n",
      "fine face expressed pain, and sorrow, and sympathy throughout, and when at\n",
      "length it was finished he still sat for several minutes in his chair,\n",
      "exhausted and panting from weariness and excitement.\n",
      "\n",
      "At last the young man turned to his companion, a great pity and tenderness\n",
      "shining in his fine, clear eyes.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Mr. Abbot,\" he said, \"you have told me one of the saddest stories that I\n",
      "have ever known, and I can find nothing but sympathy and regret for you in\n",
      "my heart. You have been but the victim of an atrocious wrong--no stain\n",
      "rests upon your character, if there appears to be upon your name, and so I\n",
      "ask you again, will you give me your daughter, if I find that I have been\n",
      "so fortunate as to have won her love? What you have related to me can\n",
      "never make any difference in my feelings toward her, and since I shall\n",
      "take her to another country, where nothing of this will ever be known or\n",
      "cast a shadow upon her future, as Lady Heath she will be honored and\n",
      "respected, and I trust, happy.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Tears welled up into the eyes of the invalid as he listened to the words\n",
      "of this true, earnest lover.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"God bless you for a noble, royal hearted man!\" he exclaimed, reaching\n",
      "forward and clasping the young baronet's hand. \"Yes, I can say God bless\n",
      "you now--for you have taught me to believe there is an Infinite Father and\n",
      "I can reverently invoke His benediction upon you. Of course I will give\n",
      "you Virgie and feel that she is richly blessed in having won such a\n",
      "husband and thus I can die with not a care upon my heart.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You have given me the richest boon that it is in my power to crave,\"\n",
      "returned Sir William, his face kindling with happiness. \"But you need not\n",
      "speak of dying. A sea voyage would prolong your life. Come with me at once\n",
      "to England and to Heathdale where you shall have every comfort and\n",
      "attention, and the change will do you good.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "A sad smile flitted over Mr. Abbot's wan features.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It is too late,\" he said, sorrowfully. \"I shall not live through another\n",
      "month; but my mind is at ease and it will be a restful season--the little\n",
      "time that I am spared. No, I shall never leave this place, but I have a\n",
      "request to make of you.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Tell me, and it shall be granted if it is in the power of man,\" returned\n",
      "Sir William, eagerly.\n",

      "her seem like some exquisite picture painted by a master-hand. Her hands,\n",
      "white as Parian marble, were quietly folded in her lap, but her heart was\n",
      "in a tumult of joy, and her color came and went in fitful flushes.\n",

      "came to you, and he told me all his sad story. But it need be no barrier\n",
      "to our happiness. I told him so, and he gave you to me--providing I could\n",
      "win you--with his blessing.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Virgie lifted her face, all radiant with a sweet new joy, a sense of\n",
      "exultation in her heart.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And you were willing----\" she began, wondering at the great love that\n",
      "could thus level what she had had feared would be an insurmountable\n",
      "barrier.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Willing, love, to make myself the happiest man on earth,\" he\n",
      "interrupted, in a voice that actually trembled with joy. \"What Mr. Abbot\n",
      "told me does not affect your worth or character, nor his either, and some\n",
      "time I believe the wrong will be made all right. Even were the facts more\n",
      "serious than they are, they need not trouble us, for I could take you far\n",
      "away from every breath of evil, and as my wife it could never touch you.\n",
      "So you will give yourself to me, Virgie?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes,\" she answered, with grave sweetness; \"if papa thinks it is right, I\n",

      "They sat there beneath the shadow of the great pine for more than an hour,\n",
      "wearing bright plans for the future, while the twilight gathered around\n",
      "them. But as yet Sir William had not told his bethrothed who he was, nor\n",
      "of the title awaiting her when she should become his wife. Somehow, he\n",
      "felt strangely reluctant to do so.\n",
      "\n",
      "Once he had spoken of his home, and Virgie looked up with sudden interest,\n",

      "significantly; \"and surely, darling you need not treat me with so much\n",
      "formality. Do not call me Mr. Heath any more, Virgie.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Please tell me where our home is to be--Will,\" she said, looking up at\n",
      "him with a shy smile, and blushing as the newly spoken name left her lips.\n",
      "\n",
      "He bent and touched them fondly with his own.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Shall I describe our home to you?\" he asked, thinking that perhaps now\n",

      "future position would be.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, do, please.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, then, imagine a large, old mansion, with many turrets and gables,\n",
      "its time-worn stones grown with ivy and moss, and set in the midst of\n",
      "extensive grounds, with grand, beautiful trees scattered all about. There\n",
      "is a great hall in the center of the house, with spacious rooms on either\n",
      "hand. At the end of this hall is the library, with two large bay-windows\n",
      "overlooking a winding river, which is the pride and glory of the place,\n",
      "and where we sail, and bathe, and fish during the summer months. Over the\n",
      "library there is a lovely suite of rooms, commanding a wide expanse of\n",
      "meadow and upland--a scene that is like a picture all the time--which will\n",
      "henceforth be devoted to the use of the future lady--of Heathdale.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Heathdale! What a pretty name!\" Virgie cried, but still unsuspicious of\n",
      "the title which would become hers when she should go with him as his wife\n",
      "to England although he had almost given utterance to it, then hesitated,\n",
      "and substituted those last two words.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, it is a pretty name, and, Virgie, the place is the pride of my\n",

      "\n",
      "\"No; but--I thought----\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You thought that I could not have very much of this world's goods since I\n",
      "had come here to work a mine,\" Sir William said, completing her sentence.\n",
      "\"But, darling, all that was only a ruse; I have been working more for my\n",
      "wife than for gold.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Will!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Darling, it is true; that was my only reason for becoming the purchaser\n",
      "of your father's interest here. I saw you; I loved you; I must have some\n",
      "good excuse for tarrying near you to try to win you, and now that I have\n",
      "attained my object, the mine will have to be disposed of, as I have no\n",
      "further use for it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Virgie regarded him with astonishment. She had never suspected anything\n",
      "like this.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"How strange,\" she said, with a beautiful flush. \"I have thought it almost\n",
      "unaccountable that a man like you should come here to remain. I have\n",
      "imagined that you were an author or a student, and might be investigating\n",
      "the formation of the mountains or studying character in order to write a\n",
      "book, but I never dreamed of anything like this.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Sir William laughed heartily.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You were making me out to be quite a lofty character truly,\" he said;\n",
      "\"and now you find your hero only a very human being after all--one who,\n",
      "for the sake of a beautiful woman, has been almost willing to barter his\n",
      "birthright. Have I fallen very low in your estimation, Virgie, because I\n",
      "am not to become a distinguished public benefactor on account of my\n",
      "research and investigation? Has my confession shocked you very much?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Your confession has made me a very, very happy woman.\" Virgie whispered,\n",
      "slipping her hand confidingly into his, her heart thrilling with a tender\n",
      "pride and love that this grand man should have sacrificed so much to win\n",
      "her.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And I am exceedingly proud of this happy woman,\" returned Sir William,\n",
      "fondly. \"I shall take the loveliest bride in the world back with me when\n",
      "we go home to Heathdale.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Where you will be Lady Heath my Virgie. Ah, I am very thankful that my\n",
      "child will occupy so proud a position in life,\" said the voice of Mr.\n",
      "Abbot, just behind them.\n",
      "\n",
      "He had come out to seek them, and had approached just as Sir William\n",
      "uttered those last words.\n",

      "Her lover a titled peer of England! This noble man, who might have chosen\n",
      "his wife from the nobility of his own country, had concealed his identity,\n",
      "had buried himself in the wilds of Nevada, and lived like a common miner\n",
      "simply to win her, an humble mountain maiden. He who belonged to an\n",
      "honored race, and possessed both title and wealth, had overlooked the fact\n",
      "that a heavy cloud enshrouded her own and her father's name, and was\n",
      "willing to lift her to the proud position of his wife and the mistress of\n",
      "his beautiful home. These and many other thoughts held her speechless, and\n",
      "made her tremble with something of fear that in the future he might regret\n",
      "it all, and wish that he had never seen her.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I am afraid I am not fitted--\" she at length faltered.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"In point of education, Virgie, you are fitted for the proudest position\n",

      "\"Oh, what a comfort it is to have you to help me at this time!\" she said.\n",
      "\n",
      "He drew her into his arms and held her for a moment while she laid her\n",
      "lips, softly and gracefully, to his cheek, in the first voluntary caress\n",
      "that she had ever given him.\n",
      "\n",
      "The act touched him, and told him how trustfully she relied upon him.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"My darling, I wish I could save you from every pang,\" he said, tenderly.\n",
      "\"But I must not linger--we must have help for your father as soon as\n",
      "possible. Good-by, my love, for a little while, and be sure that I will\n",
      "come back just as quickly as I can.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He went quickly out, and Virgie stole softly into her father's chamber, to\n",
      "do what she could for him, and her heart began to gather something of hope\n",
      "and courage when a few minutes later she heard the clatter of a horse's\n",
      "hoofs outside, and knew that her lover was on the way for help.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sir William did not spare his horse until he reached the station.\n",
      "\n",
      "A telegram was sent and before long a reply was received saying that a\n",
      "physician would leave Virginia City upon the next train coming that way.\n",
      "\n",
      "But several hours must elapse before he could arrive, and Sir William was\n",
      "brought up to the highest pitch of anxiety and impatience during the\n",
      "interval, while to Virgie, anxiously watching and waiting by the bedside\n",
      "of her father, they were the longest that she had ever known.\n",
      "\n",
      "But she followed Sir William's directions regarding administering the\n",
      "brandy, and she could see that after a few potions the invalid began to\n",
      "rally somewhat.\n",
      "\n",
      "Just as the sun was going down Sir William and the doctor arrived, and\n",
      "then the young girl felt as if a mountain had rolled from her shoulders.\n",
      "\n",
      "They remained all night watching with the patient, insisting that Virgie\n",
      "should go to her rest, and worn out with her day of watching and anxiety,\n",
      "she crept away to bed and slept the sleep of exhaustion.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the morning Mr. Abbot seemed considerably stronger and better, and\n",
      "Virgie's loving heart began to take courage again and to hope that he was\n",
      "not really so very ill after all.\n",
      "\n",
      "But these feelings received a sudden shock, when, after breakfast, her\n",
      "lover drew her into the little parlor, his face very grave, yet full of\n",
      "tenderness for her.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I have something that I wish to say to you, Virgie--something to ask\n",
      "you,\" he said; \"but, remember, that you are to answer me frankly and\n",
      "truly. You are not to be unduly influenced by my--by any one's wishes--to\n",
      "consent to what might seem premature, and thus repugnant to you.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Virgie looked up at him questioningly, growing pale, and a thrill of fear\n",
      "shooting through her heart.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Your father feels,\" Sir William went on, answering her look, \"as if he\n",
      "would like to--to have your future settled before--his strength fails him\n",
      "any further.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh!\" cried the young girl, clinging to her lover, a wild look in her\n",
      "eyes, \"papa is not going to--die! Do not tell me that. He is better\n",
      "to-day, and he will--he must grow yet stronger.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"My darling,\" said Sir William, holding her close to him, and speaking\n",
      "with sorrowful tenderness, \"I am not going to deceive you. It would not be\n",
      "right for me to do so. But Dr. Waters thinks that he cannot stay with us\n",
      "much longer. He believes that he will rally for a while, but the state of\n",
      "his system warns him that it will be but a very little while. And, Virgie,\n",
      "your father wants us to be married at once. Darling, shall it be as he\n",
      "wishes?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "But Virgie hardly heard these latter sentences.\n",
      "\n",
      "She threw herself upon that manly breast in a wild burst of grief.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was a dreadful blow to be told that the die was cast, that her father's\n",
      "doom was very near.\n",
      "\n",
      "In an indefinite way she had been dreading it ever since he himself had\n",
      "talked so plainly about it to her, but with the buoyancy of youth she had\n",
      "kept hoping against hope, and refusing to believe the fearful truth.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sir William held her in her fond embrace, and allowed her to weep until\n",
      "her tears were spent.\n",
      "\n",
      "He knew that it was better to let her grief have its way. She would be\n",
      "calmer and stronger afterward, though every sob and tear was bitter pain\n",
      "to his loving heart.\n",
      "\n",
      "She grew more quiet after a time, and at length he felt that he might\n",
      "again speak of the subject so near his heart.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Will you be my wife, Virgie? I would not have forced this upon you just\n",
      "now but for your father's desire, and because Dr. Waters, who must return\n",
      "to-day to his own duties, can make all necessary arrangements for us upon\n",
      "his arrival in Virginia City.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"A clergyman must be sent to us, and there are some other matters which I\n",
      "wish attended to, so we must decide now. Still, my darling, if you shrink\n",
      "from this step, if the thought of it shocks you, I will not urge it, I\n",
      "will wait until you are quite ready for it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Did papa propose it?\" Virgie asked, hiding her flushed face from those\n",
      "eager, loving eyes looking down upon her.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes. I should not have presumed to suggest anything of the kind at such a\n",
      "time,\" returned the young baronet, gravely. \"But he thinks that his mind\n",
      "would be easier if he could see you my wife. He wishes to give you away\n",
      "irrevocably while he is able. Then, dear, I could be with you all the time\n",
      "to help you in your care of him, to relieve you of much that would\n",
      "encroach upon your strength. Tell me freely, Virgie, shall it or shall it\n",
      "not be?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Do you really wish it? or--are you only yielding to his desire?\" she\n",
      "asked, in a low voice.\n",
      "\n",
      "He gathered her closer to his breast until she could feel the eager\n",
      "throbbing of his great heart.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The day that makes you my wife will be the most blessed of all my life;\n",
      "though, for your sake. I could wish our bridal to be celebrated under less\n",
      "sorrowful circumstances Still it must not be as I wish. You must decide\n",
      "the question,\" he said, gravely.\n",
      "\n",
      "There was a long pause. Then Virgie said, quietly:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I am willing.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Is that all, love? Are you simply willing to do as your father requests?\n",
      "Shall you not be glad to be my wife?\" Sin William questioned, with a\n",
      "slight accent of pain.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, Will, I shall be glad; but, oh, my father! my father!\" she cried,\n",
      "with a fresh burst of grief, as she realized all that this hurried\n",
      "marriage meant.\n",
      "\n",
      "He kissed her forehead softly, and breathed:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Heaven bless you, my beloved, and help me to make your future as happy\n",
      "as you have made me to-day.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He made her lie down upon the lounge, for she was nearly exhausted with\n",
      "her grief. He arranged her pillow, drew down the curtains to soften the\n",
      "light, and then went quietly out of the room.\n",
      "\n",
      "When he came back an hour later he found her calm, though with a saddened\n",
      "gravity upon her that made his heart ache.\n",
      "\n",
      "He told her that Dr. Waters had gone back to Virginia City, but that they\n",
      "had arranged for a clergyman to come to them to spend the following\n",
      "Sabbath, when Mr. Abbot desired the marriage to take place.\n",
      "\n",
      "Virgie was strangely thrilled by this intelligence. It was Tuesday, and in\n",
      "five days more she would be Sir William Heath's wife! It all seemed like a\n",
      "dream to her.\n",
      "\n",
      "On Saturday afternoon an elderly and venerable-appearing gentleman made\n",
      "his appearance before Mr. Abbots door.\n",
      "\n",
      "He came in a strong mountain wagon drawn by a pair of handsome horses, and\n",
      "with him there was a large trunk--which Sir William ordered carried up\n",
      "stairs into Virgie's room--and two or three hampers, that were given to\n",
      "Chi Lu to be taken care of.\n",
      "\n",
      "Virgie turned a wondering, inquiring look upon her lover at these\n",
      "proceedings, but he only answered by a quiet smile, and then introduced\n",
      "her to the Rev. Dr. Thornton.\n",
      "\n",
      "The young bride-elect received him with the charming ease and\n",
      "self-possession that was natural to her, at which the stranger could not\n",
      "refrain from regarding her with a look of mingled wonder and admiration.\n",
      "\n",
      "When told of the errand upon which he was to go, he had consented for the\n",
      "sake of the dying man; but he had expected to find a very rustic couple\n",
      "in this rough region, and he was wholly taken aback to meet a polished\n",
      "gentleman like Mr. Heath--as he was still known except to Virgie and her\n",
      "father--and such an interesting and lovely woman as his young hostess\n",
      "appeared to be.\n",
      "\n",
      "The clergyman spent an hour with the invalid after tea, and he was no less\n",
      "mystified and astonished regarding him. He realized that he was in a\n",
      "household of more than ordinary culture and refinement, and he was sure\n",
      "that there must be some strange history connected with their lives.\n",
      "\n",
      "When Virgie went to bid her father good-night before going to her rest, he\n",
      "drew her down to him and looked tenderly and wistfully into her face.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"My daughter,\" he questioned, \"you have no shrinking no misgivings\n",
      "regarding the step that you are about to take?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"None, papa,\" she said, softly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And are you happy in the prospect of becoming Sir William's wife? Tell me\n",
      "truly, my child.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"As happy as I can be while you are so ill, papa,\" Virgie answered, with\n",
      "starting tears.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Then I am at peace. God bless you, my darling, and may your life have\n",
      "much of sunshine in it. I give you without fear into Will's care, for I\n",
      "believe him to be one of nature's noblemen. And now,\" taking a package\n",
      "from beneath his pillow, here is your marriage dowry; it is all yours,\n",
      "Virgie, to do with as you will, and Sir William has promised to settle as\n",
      "much more upon you, which he will tell you about later. You have been a\n",
      "dear, good daughter to me, and I am very happy regarding your future; I\n",
      "could not ask or wish anything better for you.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, papa, if I could only have you well again!\" Virgie whispered, hiding\n",
      "her tearful eyes upon his pillow.\n",
      "\n",
      "An expression of pain flitted over the sick man's face.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We will not think of that now,\" he said, gently; \"and you must not give\n",
      "way to grief, for it will unnerve us both, and I do not wish to see a pale\n",
      "or sorrowful bride to-morrow. Now good-night, love, and try to get all the\n",
      "rest that you can.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He kissed her again, and was about to let her go, when he caught her hand,\n",
      "saying, with something of eagerness:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But, by the way, Virgie, what will you wear to be married in?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The young girl flushed, and her lips trembled.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh papa, I have hardly given a thought to that, my heart has been so\n",
      "heavy for you,\" she murmured, brokenly. Then she added, after a moment of\n",
      "thought: \"I have my pretty silk that you sent to San Francisco for in the\n",
      "spring, and I wondered when I should ever wear it here, you know. It will\n",
      "do, will it not?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Abbot sighed.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I suppose it will have to, since it is the best you have. I should like\n",
      "to have you married in something white, dear; but make yourself look as\n",
      "nicely as you can,\" he said in an unsteady voice.\n",
      "\n",
      "Virgie dropped a light kiss upon his forehead, and then went out, her\n",
      "heart heavy in spite of the great love which she bore the man whose wife\n",
      "she was to become on the morrow, and the bright hopes which the future\n",
      "held for her in spite of the shadow of death which was every moment\n",
      "drawing nearer.\n",

      "Virgie's Wedding-Day\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "As Virgie passed out of her father's room, Sir William captured her.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I am not going to keep you from your rest,\" he said, after caressing her\n",
      "fondly, \"but I wanted to tell you that I have been feeling a trifle\n",
      "jealous regarding the appearance of the future Lady Heath upon her\n",
      "wedding-day, and you will find everything that you will need for to-morrow\n",
      "in a trunk, which I have had carried up into your room.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Virgie lifted her head from his breast, and regarded him questioningly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I sent an order by Dr. Waters,\" he explained, \"to the best dressmaker\n",
      "that he could find in Virginia City, to provide a simple yet appropriate\n",
      "outfit for a bride, and you will find the best that could be obtained at\n",
      "so short a notice, awaiting your approval up stairs.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"How kind, how thoughtful you are!\" Virgie murmured gratefully, and with a\n",
      "flush of pleasure. \"Papa will be so pleased. He was just lamenting that I\n",
      "was not properly provided for.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Then it will be a gratifying surprise when he sees you to-morrow,\" Sir\n",
      "William returned.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Indeed it will. How can I think you? Perhaps I have been very remiss,\n",
      "but, truly, I had not given a thought to my dress,\" Virgie confessed, with\n",
      "some confusion.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"How could you, dear, with your heart so full of other things?\" Sir\n",
      "William replied, tenderly; \"and I want no thanks other than to see you\n",
      "looking like a bride,\" he concluded, smiling. \"I did this chiefly to\n",
      "gratify my own pride in my love.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He led her to the foot of the stairs, and then, with a lingering clasp,\n",
      "let her go.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was quite late, and Virgie thought that she would only allow herself a\n",
      "peep into the mysterious trunk that night; but she resolved that she would\n",
      "rise very early in the morning and lay out everything in readiness for the\n",
      "wedding.\n",
      "\n",
      "She wondered how Sir William could have managed it all, and was somewhat\n",
      "anxious regarding the fit of her bridal dress; but she was set at rest\n",
      "upon that point when she lifted the lid of the trunk and found a waist of\n",
      "one of her own dresses lying upon the top of various packages, and she\n",
      "knew that he had sent it as a measure and guide.\n",
      "\n",
      "Everything else was wrapped in fine packing paper, and she concluded not\n",
      "to open anything until morning, although her curiosity was greatly\n",
      "excited.\n",
      "\n",
      "She knelt and prayed long and fervently, for she felt very solemn in view\n",
      "of the important event that was to occur on the morrow.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then she retired, and was soon sleeping peacefully and restfully, as only\n",
      "the pure and innocent can sleep.\n",
      "\n",
      "But when the first rays of the sun streamed in at her window in the\n",
      "morning, she arose, and, after putting her room in perfect order, she\n",
      "opened the precious trunk and began to remove and undo the packages stored\n",
      "therein.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, there was a long, flat box.\n",
      "\n",
      "Opening it, she found a misty and ample veil of finest tulle, simply\n",
      "hemmed with a heavy thread of silk.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then there was another smaller but deeper box, which contained a lovely\n",
      "wreath of pure white heath, with bouquets of the same mingled with lilies\n",
      "of the valley, for the corsage of her dress.\n",
      "\n",
      "Still another, in which there was a pair of shining white satin boots,\n",
      "silken hose, and kid gloves, with a dainty handkerchief, fine and sheer as\n",
      "a cobweb.\n",
      "\n",
      "Last, but not least, incased in several wrappings of soft white paper was\n",
      "the wedding-dress.\n",
      "\n",
      "Virgie's face paled and flushed many times while she was undoing this, for\n",
      "many hopes were centered in it, and tears rose unbidden to her eyes when\n",
      "at last it was laid out on the bed before her.\n",
      "\n",
      "She had seen nothing one-half so lovely for years--not since she used to\n",
      "watch her mother dress for gay receptions and parties in the happy days so\n",
      "long ago.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was of the finest India mull, very simply yet beautifully made, over an\n",
      "underskirt of plain white silk--an airy, gauzy thing, just suited for a\n",
      "youthful bride.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"How kind! how thoughtful!\" the young girl breathed, as her glance ran\n",
      "over the different articles comprising her toilet. \"He has not forgotten a\n",
      "single thing, and it is all so delicate and beautiful. This wreath of\n",
      "heath--how suggestive! and nothing could be prettier.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh papa! I am glad you will have your wish, for it may be the very last\n",
      "one that can be gratified,\" she concluded, with a long sigh.\n",
      "\n",
      "Had it not been for her father's condition, she would have been supremely\n",
      "happy on that bright morning. Even as it was, her heart was overflowing\n",
      "with love and gratitude toward her devoted lover for his kind\n",
      "consideration and generosity.\n",
      "\n",
      "She went below at her usual hour to attend to her regular duties, which\n",
      "she performed in her customary quiet way, helping her father to rise and\n",
      "dress, arranging the rooms in the nicest order, and then serving breakfast\n",
      "to the invalid and their reverend guest.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sir William was nowhere visible. He had spent the night with Mr. Abbot,\n",
      "and when morning broke he went away to his own cabin, where he remained\n",
      "until the hour for the ceremony.\n",
      "\n",
      "The house was very quiet; there was no excitment, no bustle. Chi Lu alone\n",
      "betrayed any consciousness that an unusual event was to take place, and\n",
      "this only by a slight nervousness of manner and the restless flash of his\n",
      "dusky eyes.\n",
      "\n",
      "After breakfast Virgie saw that her father was made comfortable in his\n",
      "reclining-chair in the parlor, and then giving him one last, lingering\n",
      "kiss, she turned to go up to her chamber to dress for her bridal.\n",
      "\n",
      "Just then there came a knock on the outer door. Chi Lu was called to\n",
      "answer it, and he brought to Virgie a huge basket laden with the loveliest\n",
      "of mountain ferns and flowers, the dew still glistening upon them.\n",
      "\n",
      "They were the offering of some of the miners \"for Miss Abbot's wedding,\"\n",
      "the boy who brought them said.\n",
      "\n",
      "It had become known in some way that Mr. Abbot was failing rapidly, and\n",
      "had requested that his daughter might be married before his death.\n",
      "\n",
      "He was much respected in the hamlet, for he had always been the courteous\n",
      "gentleman, while Virgie was regarded almost in the light of a young\n",
      "princess, and thus these humble people were prompted to show their\n",
      "sympathy and good will in this delicate manner.\n",
      "\n",
      "The young bride-elect was touched to the heart by this tribute, and with\n",
      "her own hands arranged the lovely flowers to furnish the room where she\n",
      "was to be married.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then she went up stairs, and was seen no more until the hour set for the\n",
      "ceremony, which was eleven o'clock.\n",
      "\n",
      "Meanwhile Chi Lu and an elderly woman, who had once been very kind to\n",
      "Virgie when she was ill, and had been asked to \"come and help for the\n",
      "day,\" were very busily engaged in the small kitchen, arranging a repast\n",
      "which was to be served later in the day.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sir William was determined that the occasion should be made as cheerful as\n",
      "circumstances would allow, and had ordered from the city every delicacy\n",
      "which his fertile brain could suggest, and thus a \"wedding breakfast,\"\n",

      "preparation.\n",
      "\n",
      "At eleven o'clock the happy groom made his appearance and sent Margery\n",

      "transfixed upon the threshold.\n",
      "\n",
      "Virgie turned a smiling face to her. \"Why, Margery, how came you here?\"\n",

      "\n",

      "\n",
      "\"It's a boon to me, miss. You look like an angel, and I shall never\n",

      "\n",
      "Virgie felt all the happier for being able to contribute this pleasure to\n",
      "one so unused to pleasure of any kind, and she increased it tenfold by\n",

      "gloves.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, I'm ready,\" Virgie replied, as, with a vivid, conscious flush, she\n",
      "turned away, after one last look in her mirror, and truly she was a vision\n",
      "to cheer the heart of the fondest bridegroom.\n",
      "\n",
      "Her dress proved to be a perfect fit, and the delicate fabric fell in\n",
      "soft, graceful folds over the lustrous white of her silken skirt, while\n",
      "she was covered from head to foot by the mist-like veil.\n",
      "\n",
      "The wreath of heath lay lightly upon her brown head, and, with the\n",
      "beautiful bouquet upon her breast, made a pleasing contrast with the\n",
      "otherwise spotless costume.\n",
      "\n",
      "Her figure looked almost regal in her trailing robe, and she was simply\n",
      "perfect from crown to sole.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes,\" she repeated, as the woman seemed unable to take her eyes from her,\n",
      "\"you may tell Mr. Heath that I am ready,\" and as Margery went out, she\n",
      "bowed her head in prayer for a blessing on her new life.\n",
      "\n",
      "The next moment she heard Sir William's step on the stairs, and she went\n",
      "out to meet him.\n",
      "\n",
      "How his face lighted as he looked upon her! How his heart throbbed with\n",
      "exultation as he thought:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"This peerless girl is mine! Heathdale has never known a mistress so\n",
      "fair!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He was clad, as became a gentleman, in a dress suit of simple black, fine\n",
      "and rich, a single diamond of purest water gleaming just beneath his\n",
      "white satin tie, and his hands were incased in spotless gloves.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"My darling,\" he whispered, as he took Virgie's right hand and laid it on\n",
      "his arm, \"how beautiful you are!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "She could not make him any reply--the moment was too solemn for words--but\n",
      "she lifted her eyes to his for an instant, and they were filled with love\n",
      "and trust.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then they went below.\n",
      "\n",
      "Very quietly they took their places in the little parlor, where the\n",
      "clergyman awaited them, and where Mr. Abbot, after one surprised,\n",
      "delighted glance at his daughter, lay back in his chair, with a smile of\n",
      "supreme content upon his lips.\n",
      "\n",
      "He understood at once who had so delicately and so fittingly arranged\n",
      "everything for the fair bride, and it was such a comfort to him to have\n",
      "Virgie properly arrayed for her marriage.\n",
      "\n",
      "Chi Lu and Margery stood one on either side of the door, just inside the\n",
      "room, according to Sir William's desire, for there must be witnesses, and\n",
      "thus the group was complete.\n",
      "\n",
      "Rev. Dr. Thornton approached the young couple, and in an easy and\n",
      "impressive, yet graceful manner, performed the marriage service, and those\n",
      "few moments were very solemn ones to three at least of those present. But\n",
      "the ceremony was soon over, and the maiden was now a wife--Virgie Abbot\n",
      "had become Virginia, Lady Heath.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sir William had not, however, allowed his title to be used, as he shrank\n",
      "from the notoriety which the knowledge of his position and wealth would\n",
      "create among the settlers of that region. He had come there in an\n",
      "unpretentious way, and he wished to leave as quietly. There would be time\n",
      "enough, he thought, to resume his honors when he and his bride should go\n",
      "out into the world.\n",
      "\n",
      "When the benediction had been pronounced over the clasped hands of the\n",
      "husband and wife, Dr. Thornton offered his congratulations, and then Sir\n",
      "William led Virgie directly to her father.\n",
      "\n",
      "She sank upon her knees beside his chair, and putting her arms around his\n",
      "neck, gave and received a tender caress.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"God bless you always, my daughter!\" the sick man murmured, in trembling\n",
      "tones. \"I believe I am guilty of no irreverence in invoking His blessing,\"\n",
      "he added, \"for I have learned to feel my need of faith in Him, and,\n",
      "Virgie, your husband has taught me how to seek it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The young bride could only press her lips again to his in reply. She was\n",
      "very grateful for this confession, for her father's previous skepticism\n",
      "and bitterness had often caused her much sorrow.\n",
      "\n",
      "Chi Lu and Margery came forward to congratulate the bride and groom, and\n",
      "then went about their duties in the other room.\n",
      "\n",
      "Soon after, Dr. Thornton slipped quietly away, thus leaving the invalid\n",
      "and his children by themselves.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Virgie, how beautiful you are to-day! How did it happen?\" Mr. Abbot\n",

      "costume.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It was all Mr.--all Will's doing,\" she answered, with a charming blush,\n",
      "and glancing shyly up into her husband's face.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I suspected as much, and I thank you, Sir William, more than I can\n",
      "express, for giving me this unexpected pleasure,\" said the sick man,\n",
      "gratefully.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It was to gratify myself as well. I could not be satisfied unless Lady\n",
      "Heath was arrayed as became a bride of the house,\" the young baronet\n",
      "returned, with a fond smile, as he noticed how the color came and went on\n",
      "Virgie's cheek at the sound of her new name. \"But,\" he added, putting his\n",
      "arm around her, and raising her to her feet, while with one sweep of his\n",
      "hand he threw back the veil, \"I have not yet had the privilege of saluting\n",
      "my wife. Virgie, I have the right to the first kiss from your sweet lips.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The beautiful bride lifted her face to him, flushed with a new, almost\n",
      "holy, happiness.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"My husband!\" she whispered, as he held her close for a moment, and he\n",
      "felt that henceforth his life would be complete, since she loved him, and\n",
      "was his.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alas, for the weary years that were to follow!\n",

      "where Sir William exerted himself to make the occasion as merry as\n",
      "possible, and all through the day nothing occurred to mar its peace and\n",
      "joy.\n",
      "\n",
      "The next morning Dr. Thornton returned to Virginia City, carrying in his\n",

      "He had disposed of his claim some time before, for since he had no longer\n",

      "sake.\n",
      "\n",
      "At all events he was his own master, and he was not a man to tamely submit\n",

      "He did not begin to suspect, however, the bitterness which they\n",

      "married a girl from the wilds of the far West. His union had followed so\n",
      "closely upon his betrothal that he had no opportunity to communicate plans\n",
      "beforehand, and thus the news had fallen like a thunderbolt upon them.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"He has ruined his life!\" cried Lady Linton, his sister, in a white rage,\n",

      "\n",
      "\"I do not know as she has any right to say anything,\" answered the dowager,\n",
      "with some dignity, for she loved her son and could not bear to have any\n",

      "has never committed himself to her in any way; that plan has been more\n",
      "ours than his.\"\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Oh, I cannot have it so, mamma; do not let us say anything about the\n",
      "affair at present,\" pleaded her daughter. \"William says it will be some\n",

      "union.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Lady Heath demurred at first at this proposal, but she finally yielded the\n",
      "point, and nothing was said regarding the baronet's sudden marriage, and\n",

      "\n",
      "She had left the city nearly six years ago, when she was an undeveloped\n",
      "girl; she returned to it in the full glory of beautiful womanhood, and\n",
      "owing to her many changes which had occurred there, as well as in her own\n",
      "personal appearance and position, no one appeared to recognize her as the\n",
      "daughter of the unfortunate man who had figured so conspicuously in a\n",
      "terrible scandal there, and then suddenly disappeared covering his tracks\n",
      "so successfully that no one, either friend or foe, knew whither he had\n",
      "gone.\n",

      "brooding upon her father's death.\n",
      "\n",
      "They had a cozy and elegant suite of rooms at the Baldwin Hotel, which Sir\n",
      "William had engaged for the winter, and from this point they made many\n",

      "notwithstanding the seclusion of the last half-dozen years.\n",
      "\n",
      "About the middle of March they started for the East, intending to take the\n",

      "\n",
      "But Virgie, although not really ill, was far from well when they reached\n",
      "the great metropolis, and her husband insisted that she must have medical\n",
      "advice.\n",
      "\n",
      "He called in a skillful physician, who, upon being told what their plans\n",
      "were, immediately and emphatically vetoed further travel for the present.\n",

      "\n",
      "A week or two passed and Virgie appeared to be improving, when, one\n",
      "morning, there came a cablegram from Heathdale, announcing that the\n",
      "dowager Lady Heath was alarmingly ill, and imploring the baronet's\n",
      "immediate return if he desired to see her alive.\n",
      "\n",
      "The message threw the young husband into a distressing state of mind.\n",
      "\n",
      "It seemed like harshest cruelty to obey the summons and leave his wife\n",
      "alone in that strange city. And yet the alternative of remaining and\n",
      "allowing his mother to die without seeing him once more, seemed almost\n",
      "equally unkind.\n",
      "\n",
      "He sought Dr. Knox again in his extremity and explained his desperate\n",
      "situation.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I could not answer for the consequences if you take your wife; it will be\n",
      "a fearful risk for Mrs. Heath to go. She <i>might</i> endure the voyage safely,\n",
      "but the probabilities are that she would not,\" the physician gravely told\n",
      "him. \"But,\" he added, kindly, \"I sympathize with you--I appreciate your\n",
      "dilemma, and, if <i>you</i> must go, I advise you to leave her in my charge and\n",
      "I promise faithfully to give her every attention during your enforced\n",
      "absence.\"\n",
      "\n",

      "the thought of the separation, for it <i>might</i> be that she would never see\n",
      "him again.\n",
      "\n",
      "Still she was brave--she put aside her own feelings out of regard for the\n",
      "duty which he owed his mother, and there was a possibility that he could\n",
      "return to her in the course of two or three weeks.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Do not feel unduly anxious for me, Will,\" she said to him, on the evening\n",
      "before he was to sail, \"I know that Dr. Knox will do all for me that you\n",
      "can wish. I will either write or send some message to you by every\n",
      "steamer, and I am going to trust that everything will be well.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But it is agony to me to leave you--oh! my darling, if your heart fails\n",
      "you in the least, if you say you prefer to have me stay, I will not go\n",
      "even now,\" he said, his own courage failing him and having more than half\n",
      "a mind to renounce his intended voyage even at that late hour.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, dear, I know that it is your duty to go,\" Virgie answered, gently. \"I\n",

      "from her at such a time.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But if--I should lose you, too,\" he was going to say, but checked himself\n",
      "and concluded, \"but if you should be neglected and unhappy?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I shall not be, Will; you have provided against the former contingency\n",
      "most generously, and the latter I can regulate myself. I will not be\n",
      "unhappy, for I know that you are doing right and that you will return to\n",
      "me the moment that you are at liberty to do so.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Indeed I shall,\" he answered, as he gathered her close to his breast and\n",
      "rained passionate kisses upon her lovely face.\n",
      "\n",
      "But his heart was very heavy notwithstanding her apparent cheerfulness.\n",
      "\n",
      "A superstitious dread seemed to have seized him, warning him that some\n",
      "fearful calamity would follow this separation. He was not given to such\n",
      "unreasonable imaginings, and he reproached himself for indulging in them;\n",
      "but he could not shake them off nevertheless.\n",
      "\n",
      "Morning came and with it the hour of departure and the last farewells.\n",
      "\n",
      "Virgie wore a brave and even smiling face through all. She had resolved\n",
      "that she would not unman him at the last moment.\n",
      "\n",

      "inclined, although he wondered that she did not make some inquiry\n",

      "The meeting with his sister had been somewhat cold and formal, for he\n",

      "all her ambitious hopes for him.\n",
      "\n",
      "Like his mother, she ignored the subject of his marriage not deigning to\n",

      "greatly astonished at the non-appearance of Virgie, and was burning with\n",
      "curiosity to know why he had returned alone.\n",
      "\n",
      "This negligence and obstinacy on her part made Sir William very indignant,\n",

      "he determined to assert himself, and have it distinctly understood that\n",
      "his wife was henceforth to be recognized as a member of and a power in his\n",

      "\n",
      "Therefore, the morning following his return he had drawn Lady Linton into\n",

      "\"Miriam, you have not yet done me the honor to inquire after Lady Heath.\"\n",

      "\n",
      "\"It is evident that you are still very angry with me, and intend to annoy\n",

      "each other at the outset. I shall demand and expect that my wife when I\n",
      "bring her home, will be received with all the honor and courtesy which has\n",
      "ever been accorded to the mistress of Heathdale in the past.\"\n",
      "\n",

      "here--perhaps you will do me the favor to look at them.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He laid two or three fine photographs of Virgie, taken in different\n",
      "attitudes, before her, as he concluded, and then leaned back in his chair\n",
      "watching her attentively to see what effect that beautiful face would have\n",
      "upon her.\n",
      "\n",
      "Her ladyship adjusted her eyeglasses with English precision, and taking up\n",
      "one of the pictures regarded it with all the indifference which she could\n",
      "muster. She was not, however, quite prepared for what she saw; and the\n",
      "quick, curious, half-admiring gleam which shot into her eye told that she\n",
      "had not failed to acknowledge the exceeding loveliness of that fair face,\n",
      "and the natural grace and dignity displayed in the young wife's attitude.\n",
      "\n",
      "She took up each picture separately, and her brother could see her\n",
      "indifference gradually melting away, a keen and critical look taking its\n",
      "place.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Who was she?\" she at length condescended to ask, though somewhat curtly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The daughter of a California gentleman,\" Sir William answered, quietly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"A California <i>gentleman!</i>\" with a scornful accent upon the last word.\n",
      "\"You speak of him as of an equal.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Certainly,\" returned the baronet, a smile of amusement slightly curling\n",
      "his lips, \"Mr. Abbot was my equal, if not my superior, in point of\n",
      "intellect, and all that goes to make a gentleman, while his daughter is\n",
      "in no wise my inferior.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"How can you make such an absurd statement, William?\" demanded his sister,\n",
      "impatiently. \"The idea of an American plebeian being the equal of a Heath\n",
      "of Heathdale!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Sir William laughed outright; then he said:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Your loyalty to your family does you credit, Miriam, but I imagine, if\n",
      "you should ever visit America--which I trust for your own sake, you will\n",
      "do some time--that you will return much wiser than you went. Your ideas\n",
      "regarding people and things, in that grand republic are very crude and\n",
      "incorrect. But how do you like the face that I have shown you?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The face is well enough,\" Lady Linton was forced to admit.\n",
      "\n",
      "There is nothing weak about it?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"N-o.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It is not lacking in intelligence or character?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Not so far as I am able to judge from a simple picture\", the woman\n",
      "confessed, rather reluctantly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And yet it does not flatter her; you do not often see a face like that\n",
      "even among the noble families of England, and she is as lovely in mind as\n",
      "in person,\" said Sir William, fondly, as he took up one of the photographs\n",
      "and gazed upon it with his heart in his eyes.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Humph! if you are so proud of your American bride, why did you not bring\n",
      "her home with you?\" Lady Linton inquired, in a mocking tone, and then\n",
      "could have bitten her tongue through for having allowed herself to betray\n",
      "her curiosity so far.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sir William flushed hotly. It was evident that his sister was no more\n",
      "reconciled since seeing Virgie's pictures than before. Her pride of birth\n",
      "had received a shock which she could neither overlook nor forgive.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Lady Heath was not able to travel. Her physician told me that if she\n",
      "crossed the ocean it would be at the risk of her life. Miriam, Virgie will\n",
      "soon become a mother, God willing.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Lady Linton started and shot a swift look of astonishment at her brother\n",
      "upon this unexpected announcement.\n",
      "\n",
      "This information was disagreeable in the extreme, for it made certain\n",
      "plans, which her fertile brain had begun to weave as soon as she had\n",
      "learned that her brother had returned without his wife, all the more\n",
      "complicated, if not well-nigh impossible.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It was a great trial for me to return without her,\" Sir William went on,\n",
      "with a regretful sigh, \"but your summons was so very imperative that I\n",
      "felt obliged to do so. My darling bore it very bravely, however; she\n",
      "regarded it as my duty to hasten to my mother, even though she would be\n",
      "left alone, a stranger in a great city, and at such a critical time.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Of course it was your duty to return to our mother,\" Lady Linton\n",
      "responded emphatically, as if the young wife away upon the other side of\n",
      "the Atlantic was not worthy of consideration. \"And,\" she added, flashing a\n",
      "look of defiance at her companion, \"I am free to confess to a feeling of\n",
      "relief that you had to come alone--\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Miriam, I--\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Hear me out, if you please,\" she interposed. \"Mamma's heart has been\n",
      "nearly broken at the thought of this ill-assorted marriage, and I believe\n",
      "the excitement and grief would have killed her outright, if you had\n",
      "brought her,\" with a withering glance at Virgie's picture, \"to Heathdale\n",
      "to reign as mistress.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Sir William was tried almost beyond endurance. It was more than a minute\n",
      "before he could control himself sufficiently to speak, after his sister's\n",
      "insulting remarks regarding his marriage.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Miriam,\" he at length said, in a voice that made her quail in spite of\n",
      "her effrontery, \"you will please never speak like this again; it is, both\n",
      "to my wife and me, an insult which I will not tolerate. Virgie is a lady\n",
      "in every sense of the word; even my critical mother could pick no flaw in\n",
      "her were she to see her, and the moment that I am at liberty to do so I\n",
      "shall return to the United States and bring my darling back with me. And\n",
      "let me here repeat what I said a while ago--I expect and demand that she\n",

      "\n",
      "\"The household knows nothing of your marriage.\"\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "\"No one, save mamma and I, knows anything of this--this alliance.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"By whose authority have you kept such a matter secret?\" Sir William\n",
      "demanded, in great wrath.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We--we thought it best,\" faltered his sister, shrinking beneath his\n",
      "anger--she had never seen him so aroused before. \"Mamma was so unhappy,\n",
      "and I was so--so unreconciled, that we determined to wait until you wrote\n",
      "definitely regarding your coming.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You have overstepped all bounds, you have presumed beyond excuse,\"\n",
      "retorted her brother, in a voice of thunder. \"I know that you are my\n",
      "senior by fifteen years, and as a boy I was taught to look up to you, and\n",
      "to render you the respect due an elder. But I am a child no longer. I am a\n",
      "man, and you forget that I am not only my own master, but the master of\n",
      "Heathdale as well. I have a right to choose for myself in all matters, and\n",
      "you are not to consider that I am in leading strings, as I was before\n",
      "your marriage, when you exercised, to a certain extent, authority over\n",
      "me. And now if--I abhor thrifts, but I wish you to distinctly understand\n",
      "me--if you cannot bring yourself to regard my marriage in a proper and\n",
      "sensible light, and make up your mind to receive my wife as becomes a\n",
      "sister of the house, the doors of Heathdale will henceforth be closed to\n",
      "you.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Lady Linton was astounded at this outburst.\n",
      "\n",
      "Her brother, heretofore, had always been a pattern of amiability and\n",
      "gentleness, and had allowed her to have her own way mostly in the house.\n",
      "In minor matters she had always ruled him, and she had never imagined that\n",
      "he could rise to such a height as this.\n",
      "\n",
      "She saw that she had gone too far, that she must change her tactics, or\n",
      "forever lose all influence with him, and make an enemy of him.\n",
      "\n",
      "She could ill afford to do this for several reasons.\n",
      "\n",
      "She was the widow of Lord Percival Linton, who had married her chiefly for\n",
      "her large dowry.\n",
      "\n",
      "He had been a fast, unprincipled man, who had run through his own property\n",
      "and most of hers before death put an end to his mad career.\n",
      "\n",
      "They had one son, Percy, and a daughter, Lillian, and Lady Linton, with\n",
      "her two children, had been largely dependent upon the generosity of her\n",
      "brother ever since her husband's death, and he was even now bearing all\n",
      "the expense of the education of his nephew and niece.\n",
      "\n",
      "They had made their home chiefly at Heathdale, because Lady Linton's pride\n",
      "could not tolerate life at Linton Grange when they had no means to keep it\n",
      "up in proper style, and it was very pleasant and comfortable to be in her\n",
      "brother's home, where there was abundance of everything, and where she had\n",
      "been allowed to manage the household in her own way.\n",
      "\n",
      "It would therefore be very mortifying to have its hospitable doors closed\n",
      "against her, and, finding herself liable to be ignominiously checkmated if\n",
      "she persisted in her present course, she resolved to \"right about face\"\n",
      "with the greatest grace possible, at least until she was obliged to yield\n",
      "her position to the future mistress of Heathdale.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Fie, William, don't allow yourself to get in such a passion,\" she said,\n",
      "in a conciliatory tone. \"Perhaps I have expressed myself more freely than\n",
      "I ought, but you ought to make allowance for our great disappointment.\n",
      "Remember that you are the pride of an old and honored family, and it is\n",
      "but natural that we should wish you to marry in your own station. But do\n",
      "not fear. When Lady Heath comes to take her place as mistress here she\n",
      "shall be received in a becoming manner.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Her ladyship arose as she ceased speaking, her eye falling as she did so\n",
      "upon the lovely upturned face upon the table, and she vowed in her heart\n",
      "that if she could prevent it, the girl should never set her foot over the\n",
      "threshold of Heathdale.\n",
      "\n",
      "How she was to carry out this vow she had as yet no idea; but all the\n",
      "malice and enmity of her heart had been aroused against her, and it should\n",
      "go hard with her if she could not find some way to vent it upon her.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Thank you, Miriam,\" Sir William responded, as he opened the door for his\n",
      "sister to pass out, but he spoke somewhat coldly.\n",
      "\n",
      "He could not lightly forgive and overlook the scorn that had been heaped\n",
      "upon the darling of his heart, while the fact that his marriage had been\n",
      "kept a secret angered him exceedingly, and placed him in a very unpleasant\n",
      "position.\n",
      "\n",
      "He resolved that as soon as his mother should be better, he would have a\n",
      "plain talk with her, also, and insist upon an announcement of Lady Heath's\n",
      "existence and her expected arrival. But until the invalid was out of\n",
      "danger he deemed it advisable not to create any excitement on the subject.\n",

      "unpacking of his trunks and putting his wardrobe in order.\n",
      "\n",
      "While thus engaged she came across a worn portfolio filled with papers of\n",

      "She knew at once that it was nothing that belonged to her brother, and\n",

      "Accordingly, she boldly and unhesitatingly unlocked the portfolio, and\n",
      "began examining its contents.\n",
      "\n",
      "These proved to be mostly business papers and legal documents, with some\n",
      "letters directed to a name that she had never heard before. She would have\n",
      "liked to read them, but she feared being interrupted while doing so, and\n",
      "she of course had no wish to have her brother know she was prying thus\n",
      "into his affairs so she laid them back in their place, resolving at some\n",
      "future time to examine them more thoroughly. But there was one envelope\n",
      "among them of much fresher appearance than the others, and with no address\n",
      "upon it, although it contained a document of some kind.\n",

      "She was astonished to find that the ceremony had occurred in some place in\n",
      "Nevada, remote from any city or town--a little settlement of which she had\n",
      "never heard--and as she read further, her eyes grew wide with astonishment\n",

      "\"There is some inexplicable mystery about this thing,\" she murmured. \"The\n",

      "morning as she was pacing slowly back and forth, thinking of her absent\n",

      "encountered two ladies who had just ascended the stairs, and passed on to\n",
      "their apartments which were just beyond hers.\n",
      "\n",
      "One was a finely formed, majestic woman, evidently somewhat over fifty\n",
      "years, having the air and bearing of one accustomed to society and the\n",
      "ways of the world. She was tastefully and elegantly dressed, every article\n",
      "of her apparel denoting wealth and a careful regard for fashion.\n",
      "\n",
      "The other was a young lady, perhaps a year or two older than Virgie, a\n",
      "perfect blonde, with a tall, beautifully developed form, and with a face\n",
      "such as poets and artists rave about. It was a pure oval, faultless in\n",
      "feature and coloring, and yet withal, if closely studied, there was a\n",
      "suspicion of shallowness and insincerity in the full, sapphire eyes, and\n",
      "the perfectly formed but rather weak mouth.\n",
      "\n",
      "Still Virgie, as she lifted her own lovely eyes and beheld this young\n",
      "lady, thought she had never seen any one more beautiful, while she colored\n",
      "slightly, and wondered why the strangers should observe her so closely\n",
      "and with such evident interest.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was a very warm day, and she was clad in a fine white robe, richly\n",
      "embroidered and garnished with pale lavender ribbon. If she had but\n",
      "realized it, she was exquisitely beautiful herself, with her glossy, brown\n",
      "hair carelessly yet gracefully coiled at the back of her head, the color\n",
      "beginning to tinge her cheeks, that smile of happiness upon her sweet\n",
      "lips, and the holy mother-light shining in her violet eyes.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Mamma, that must be she; that must be Lady Heath,\" whispered the younger\n",
      "of the two strangers, when they had passed beyond hearing.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Lady Heath!\" was the scornful repetition, accompanied by a flash of anger\n",
      "from the dark eyes of the elder woman.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, mamma, you know of course who I mean. She must be the girl whom\n",
      "Lady Linton wrote about.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I imagine so. She answers the description that Miriam gave of her\n",

      "baby's cry.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, at last we have seen her,\" returned the girl, \"and I must confess,\n",
      "I think she is perfectly lovely. She has such beautiful eyes, such a fair,\n",
      "delicate complexion, and is so peculiarly dainty every way. I do not blame\n",
      "Sir William for falling in love with her.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Mercy, Sadie, how you do chatter! no one would believe, to hear you, that\n",

      "\n",
      "The young girl flushed crimson at this shaft.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Thank you, mamma, for reminding me of the fact,\" she said, bitterly. \"It\n",

      "suppose I ought to bitterly hate her for it; but truly her exceeding\n",
      "beauty and sweetness half disarm me.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The elder woman made no reply to this, but her manner betrayed both\n",
      "contempt and irritation, her brow was clouded with a wrathful expression,\n",

      "It will readily be surmised that these two ladies were none other than\n",

      "Mrs. Farnum had married while very young, and was the mother of three\n",
      "children--two sons and one daughter.\n",
      "\n",
      "She had herself been very attractive as a girl, and had many suitors; but\n",
      "with an eye to the comforts of life, she had said \"no\" to all the titled\n",
      "and impecunious lovers, and given her hand to a man of wealth, who, with\n",
      "his million of pounds, bade fair to add another million to them in the\n",
      "course of time.\n",
      "\n",
      "Miriam Heath, on the contrary, had been rather a plain-looking girl,\n",
      "somewhat cold and repelling in manner, and was almost an old maid before\n",
      "she was married; thus she was often an inmate of her friend's palatial\n",
      "home, and became much interested in her children, and little Sadie Farnum\n",
      "had scarcely reached her teens before the two women began to plan a union\n",
      "between the young heir of Heathdale and the heiress to half a million\n",

      "It had been the cherished dream of years, while almost from childhood\n",

      "and to look upon Sir William as her promised husband; thus the\n",
      "disappointment had been a terrible one to them all when they learned that\n",
      "the baronet had married a \"nobody\" from the hated and disloyal country\n",
      "that had rebelled against its rightful sovereign.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lady Linton might be said to have become almost a monomaniac upon this\n",
      "point, and so bitter was her ire at thus being balked in her plans, so\n",
      "keen her hatred of the innocent girl who had been the cause of it, that\n",
      "she abandoned herself to the wildest schemes, casting all honor and\n",
      "womanliness to the winds, and bending all her energies toward the\n",
      "destruction of the happiness of the newly wedded couple. She resolved to\n",
      "begin operations by making an ally of her friend, Mrs. Farnum.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fortunately she was at that moment in California, the former home of\n",
      "Virgie, and could perhaps ascertain what mystery overshadowed her former\n",
      "life that had made it necessary to conceal her true name. This would\n",
      "perhaps give a clew how to proceed further, and, as we know, her letter\n",
      "was written at once, and brought an immediate reply. Further\n",
      "correspondence elicited information which only tended to strengthen Lady\n",
      "Linton in her evil designs, and Mrs. Farnum was advised to proceed\n",
      "directly to New York and take up her abode in the same hotel where Virgie\n",
      "was located, where she could successfully aid and abet her superior in her\n",
      "malicious operations.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thus we find Mrs. Farnum and her daughter not only in the same house, but\n",
      "on the same floor with the young wife and her child, and only waiting for\n",
      "a favorable opportunity to strike a fatal blow to her happiness.\n",

      "\n",
      "For a while this had only filled her with hope, for she had told herself\n",
      "that doubtless he was coming for her; he might even be on the way to give\n",
      "her a joyful surprise. But as time went on and not a word came from him,\n",
      "she was haunted with a sickening dread. He might be ill, she reasoned; but\n",
      "surely in that case he would send some message by another, or, if he could\n",
      "not do that, some member of her family would certainly let her know.\n",
      "\n",
      "She wrote faithfully, notwithstanding, giving all details regarding\n",
      "herself and their little one, never dreaming that her fond letters, having\n",

      "flames.\n",

      "Every day after the arrival of Mrs. Farnum and her daughter, one or both\n",

      "\n",
      "But Virgie was retiring by nature, and the acquaintance did not progress\n",
      "rapidly enough to suit Mrs. Farnum, and she was meditating a bold move,\n",

      "Heathdale.\n",
      "\n",

      "and she must have some exercise.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Virgie herself appeared in the doorway of her parlor at this moment, and\n",
      "smiled as she noticed the young lady admiring her baby.\n",
      "\n",
      "Miss Farnum colored slightly, then said boldly, with a light laugh:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Pray do not think me very bold, Mrs. Heath, but I have been seeking an\n",
      "introduction to your little daughter. She is very lovely, and I am <i>so</i>\n",
      "fond of babies.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "While she spoke her eyes had been fixed upon Virgie's face, and she\n",
      "thought she had never looked upon any one more beautiful than this woman\n",
      "who was her rival--for so she regarded her.\n",
      "\n",
      "She wore a delicate blue lawn, trimmed profusely with filmy white lace;\n",
      "there was a dainty cap upon her head, while she had a few blush-roses\n",
      "fastened in her belt. Every day she was growing stronger and better, and\n",
      "her beauty seemed to increase in proportion.\n",
      "\n",
      "She bowed to Sadie, and smiled again as she remarked that it was rather\n",
      "unusual for young ladies to be so fond of children of that tender age.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Then I am an exception to the rule, Mrs. Heath,\" Miss Farnum answered;\n",
      "\"but since I have made your daughter's acquaintance, allow me to introduce\n",
      "myself to you also. I am Sadie Farnum, and mamma and I are your nearest\n",
      "left-hand neighbors.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I am very glad to know you, Miss Farnum,\" Virgie returned, graciously,\n",
      "and thinking her delightfully frank and pleasant.\n",
      "\n",
      "She was really very glad to meet her in a less formal way than usual, and\n",
      "hoped they should be friends.\n",
      "\n",
      "She had been feeling rather lonely of late, besides being depressed on\n",
      "account of her husband's long silence; she had no acquaintances, and saw\n",
      "scarcely any one save the physician and her nurse.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I am afraid mamma will think I have committed a shocking breach of\n",
      "etiquette,\" Sadie went on; \"but we are strangers in the city, and I have\n",
      "been longing to know you ever since our first meeting here in the\n",
      "corridor. May I come in to see you occasionally, and this little darling?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "She concluded with such a winning air, as she stooped and lightly kissed\n",
      "the tiny pink face lying upon the nurse's arm, that Virgie's heart was\n",
      "entirely won.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, indeed, Miss Farnum; I should be delighted to have you. I am alone\n",
      "most of the time, and it would be very pleasant to have some young\n",
      "company.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Thank you. Then, if you do not object, I will waive all ceremony, and\n",
      "come to see you in a friendly way. May I bring mamma, too, and introduce\n",
      "her to you?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I shall be very glad to meet Mrs. Farnum,\" Virgie responded, and then\n",
      "instantly asked herself if she had spoken the exact truth, for she stood\n",
      "somewhat in awe of that aristocratic and imposing looking woman, whose\n",
      "curious, piercing glance, in spite of her assumption of friendliness, gave\n",
      "her an unpleasant sensation.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Mamma, the ice is broken at last!\" Sadie Farnum cried, rushing in upon\n",
      "her mother, with a glowing face, after the above interview, and she\n",
      "proceeded to give her a detailed account of her meeting with Virgie.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"She is as lovely as a dream, mamma,\" she said, \"and as sweet and gracious\n",
      "as any lady need to be. If she were not Sir William Heath's wife I should\n",
      "be ready to do homage at her shrine with all my heart.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Nonsense! Has she any education? Can she converse respectably?\" demanded\n",
      "Mrs. Farnum, with a frown at her daughter's enthusiasm.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"She is a perfect lady, and her language is beyond criticism--she is fit\n",
      "to be the wife of any peer.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Gracious! Sadie, how you annoy me!\" ejaculated Mrs. Farnum, angrily.\n",
      "\"Just think of her antecedents.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, the girl is not to blame if her father was a scamp, and should not\n",
      "be made to suffer for his sins,\" responded her daughter, who was not\n",
      "naturally bad, and but for her mother's influence, would even now have\n",
      "been won to a better disposition by Virgie's sweetness.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What rank folly you are talking!\" retorted her mother. \"No girl has a\n",
      "right to marry a respectable man with such a stain on her name.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Perhaps she does not know anything about her father's crime.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Pshaw! She was fifteen years old when they had to flee from San\n",
      "Francisco; she could not help knowing that something was wrong, and as she\n",
      "grew older she could not fail to understand it. From the way you talk it\n",
      "is evident that you yourself have fallen in love with the woman who has\n",
      "cheated you out of your husband.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Perhaps I have, mamma,\" Sadie answered, with a spice of defiance and\n",
      "wickedly taking pleasure in working her mother up to a certain pitch. \"She\n",
      "looked so pretty just now--she has the loveliest complexion, just clear\n",
      "red and white, with such dark blue eyes that they seem almost black when\n",
      "she is animated, and such pretty waving brown hair, while her features are\n",
      "pure and delicate Her taste, too, is exquisite--her dress was just the\n",
      "right shade to set off her clear skin; she had the daintiest little\n",
      "matron's cap on her head--real thread, too--while a handful of blush-roses\n",
      "in her belt made her look too lovely for anything.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Do hush, Sadie; you irritate me beyond endurance; one would think that\n",
      "you were only too ready to renounce all your hopes to this plebeian who\n",
      "has stolen your lover,\" and Mrs. Farnum turned upon her daughter as if\n",
      "ready to shake her for her folly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Mamma!\" she cried, passionately, and bursting into tears, for she had\n",
      "been working herself up as well, \"when I am away from her I hate her for\n",
      "having won him from me, and I am almost ready to do anything desperate;\n",
      "but when I am with her she disarms me; there is something about the girl\n",
      "that almost makes me love her. If you could have seen her this morning,\n",
      "she looked so proud and happy when I praised the baby.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Sadie Farnum, I do believe you are becoming demented! Here is poor Lady\n",
      "Linton almost heart-broken over her brother's <i>mesalliance</i>, his mother\n",
      "lies at death's door on account of the excitement caused by it, while you,\n",
      "who ought to be the most interested party of all, are about to turn\n",
      "traitress and go over to the enemy just because of a foolish\n",
      "sentimentality for this doll-faced girl. I declare, I have no patience\n",
      "with you.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I think you have said enough, mamma,\" replied Miss Farnum, coldly, and\n",
      "wiping away her tears, \"but there may come a time when you will regret\n",
      "your present attitude--when you will be sorry that you strove to inculcate\n",
      "such a bitter spirit into the mind of your only daughter. Lady Linton for\n",
      "some strange reason wanted us to come here and see for ourselves what this\n",
      "girl is like; we have seen her. Let us go our way now and not revive old\n",
      "hopes and ambitions, which, to say the least, are not pleasant to remember\n",
      "under the circumstances. Yes, let us end this disagreeable business, and\n",
      "leave Sir William Heath's wife alone.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I am not ready to leave New York yet, and we will stay where we are for\n",
      "the present,\" responded Mrs. Farnum, flushing a deep red, for she had\n",
      "never told her daughter of the plot which she was helping Lady Linton to\n",
      "carry out, and she saw now that it would not be wise to do so, since Sadie\n",
      "might flatly refuse to have anything to do with it, and in her present\n",
      "state of mind, might do something to upset their well-laid schemes.\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The acquaintance between the Farnums and Virgie progressed rapidly after\n",
      "the meeting between Sadie and the young wife. Mrs. Farnum was duly\n",
      "introduced, and did not prove to be nearly so formidable a personage as\n",
      "Virgie had imagined her to be; for although she was not drawn toward her\n",
      "as she had been to her daughter, yet she was so gracious and exerted\n",
      "herself to be so agreeable, that Virgie could but acknowledge to herself\n",
      "that she was a very pleasant and entertaining person.\n",
      "\n",
      "Visits were exchanged almost every day between them; the baby was praised\n",
      "and admired, and Virgie was petted and made much of, until her heart and\n",
      "confidence were entirely won.\n",
      "\n",
      "They insisted upon her driving with them; \"the fresh air would do her\n",
      "good,\" Mrs. Farnum declared, \"for she had noticed during the last week\n",
      "that she was losing color;\" and thus she made many excursions with the two\n",
      "ladies, and visited many points of interest. They even proposed that they\n",
      "should go into the country together, as it was getting so oppressively\n",
      "warm in the city; but Virgie would not listen to this proposition, because\n",
      "of her anxiety for letters, and the hope that Sir William might be coming\n",
      "for her.\n",
      "\n",
      "Poor child! she was, indeed, losing color, and was almost heart-sick with\n",
      "the terrible suspense, although she tried to be very brave and to conceal\n",
      "her trouble from every eye.\n",
      "\n",
      "She wrote again and again to her husband, begging for one line, one word\n",
      "even, pleading that he would let her come to him if he was ill and needed\n",
      "her. She would gladly brave the dangers of the ocean alone, she told him,\n",
      "if he would but give her his consent to do so.\n",
      "\n",
      "But still that terrible silence remained unbroken.\n",
      "\n",
      "She was almost tempted to set out alone in spite of everything, and\n",
      "nothing but the fear of passing her husband on the way prevented her doing\n",
      "so.\n",
      "\n",
      "She had learned that the Farnums were English, but upon discovering that\n",
      "their home was a long distance from Heathdale--Mr. Farnum owned a large\n",
      "estate in Bedford County--she reasoned that they could not know anything\n",
      "of Sir William's family; and being extremely sensitive regarding his\n",
      "recent apparent neglect of her, she did not once hint that she expected\n",
      "her own future home would also be in England.\n",
      "\n",
      "Meantime Lady Linton's plans were ripening. Events were occurring at\n",
      "Heathdale which she trusted would serve her purpose well; and now Mrs.\n",
      "Farnum was only waiting for a favorable opportunity to commence aggressive\n",
      "operations.\n",
      "\n",
      "The opportunity soon came. Sadie had been invited by some friends to spend\n",
      "a week or two at Coney Island, and her mother, fearing if she should be\n",
      "there to witness Virgie's grief when she began to work out her plot, that\n",
      "she might do something to upset her plans, willingly gave her consent for\n",
      "her to go.\n",
      "\n",
      "On the afternoon after her departure, Mrs. Farnum with a basket of fancy\n",
      "work in hand, went to pay Virgie a little visit, saying she was lonely\n",
      "without Sadie, and had come in for a cozy chat.\n",
      "\n",
      "The young wife had evidently been weeping, for her cheeks were flushed and\n",
      "her eyes heavy, but she received her guest cordially, and exerted herself\n",
      "to be entertaining.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Farnum appeared unconscious of anything unusual although she watched\n",
      "the young wife keenly, and readily surmised what had caused her\n",
      "unhappiness.\n",
      "\n",
      "She chatted socially for a while on various topics, but after a time laid\n",
      "down her work, and taking up a book from a table near which she was\n",
      "sitting, began carelessly turning over its pages.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Jean Ingelow,\" she remarked, with a smile. \"Are you fond of her poetry,\n",
      "Mrs. Heath?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes,\" Virgie answered, \"I think some of her poems are very sweet.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Farnum glanced absently at two or three, then turned to the fly leaf\n",
      "of the book, while Virgie's eyes mechanically followed her movements.\n",
      "\n",
      "The name of William Heath was written there.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Farnum looked up surprised, then smiled.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Your husband's name is William?\" she said, inquiringly\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes,\" Virgie returned, with a slight flush, while a pang shot through her\n",
      "heart at the sound of the dear name.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You must be very lonely to be separated from him for so long a time,\"\n",
      "said the woman, in a sympathetic tone.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Indeed I am,\" said the young wife, with a long-drawn sigh which did not\n",
      "escape her companion's notice, \"but our separation is compulsory.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Ah, he was away at the time of our arrival, was he not?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, he was called to his home nearly three months ago by the illness of\n",
      "his mother.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Farnum assumed a look of surprise.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And could not you accompany him?\" she asked, as if she thought it very\n",
      "strange that Virgie should not have done so.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, my physician would not allow me to travel; the summons came only a\n",
      "short time before the birth of my baby, and he said a sea voyage could not\n",
      "be thought of for me, so my husband was obliged to go without me.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"A sea voyage!\" repeated Mrs. Farnum, with a start.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes. My husband's home is in England,\" Virgie answered, flushing vividly.\n",
      "\n",
      "A blank look came over Mrs. Farnum's face, then she assumed a grieved\n",
      "expression.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"In England! and you never told us that you were our countrywoman, Mrs.\n",
      "Heath!\" she said, reproachfully.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I am not. I am a native of California,\" Virgie explained with some\n",
      "confusion; but I seldom speak of myself to strangers.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"With good reason, my pert young woman!\" mentally retorted Mrs, Farnum,\n",
      "for her companion's last words had been rather coldly uttered. Then she\n",
      "said aloud, in a pitying tone:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It must have been very trying for you to let your husband go on such a\n",
      "journey without you?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, indeed, it was,\" Virgie replied, with lips that quivered painfully;\n",
      "\"but, of course, I could not keep him from his dying mother.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Was her condition so critical as that?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Certainly, or my husband would not have consented to leave me. Mrs. Heath\n",
      "was suddenly stricken with paralysis.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Again Mrs. Farnum started, and bent a long, searching look upon her\n",
      "companion--a look that made Virgie feel very uncomfortable and wonder what\n",
      "it meant.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Is--is she still living?\" the woman asked, still regarding Virgie\n",
      "searchingly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes--at least, she was the last I heard; but her condition was still\n",
      "considered so critical that she could not bear the least excitement.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Then it is some time since you have heard from her?\" remarked Mrs.\n",
      "Farnum, pointedly.\n",
      "\n",
      "Virgie bridled a trifle at being so closely questioned. She thought her\n",
      "guest was trespassing beyond the bounds of good breeding. But, after a\n",
      "moment, feeling as if she must share her burden with some one, she said,\n",
      "in an unsteady voice:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, I have not, and--I am afraid that my husband's letters have\n",
      "miscarried, and the suspense has been very trying.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Ahem! Mrs. Heath, there is something very strange--very inexplicable\n",
      "about what you have told me,\" Mrs. Farnum said, in a grave tone.\n",
      "\n",
      "Virgie looked up, astonished both at the words and tone.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I do not understand you,\" she returned.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You know, of course, that we are English people,\" began her companion.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes. Miss Sadie mentioned the fact to me during the first of our\n",
      "acquaintance.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Did she ever tell you that we know people in England by the name of\n",
      "Heath?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No. Do you?\" Virgie cried, eagerly, her face lighting as she thought\n",
      "perhaps she might learn something regarding her long silent husband.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, and they are a very fine family. They belong in Hampshire, and I may\n",
      "as well tell you that they are a very proud and aristocratic family,\n",
      "laying great stress upon their unimpeachable honor and untarnished name.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Virgie flushed a painful crimson at this, which her companion noticed\n",
      "with a thrill of exultation, and then resumed:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The oldest daughter, who married a peer of the realm, has been my most\n",
      "intimate friend for many years. Sir William, also----\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Sir William!\" Virgie interrupted, catching her breath, face growing\n",
      "radiant.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, that's the name of the son and heir. I was about to remark that he\n",
      "is a baronet and that it is a singular coincidence that he should also\n",
      "have been here in America while his mother was stricken with paralysis. It\n",
      "is strange, too, that his first name should be the same as your husband's;\n",
      "but----\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, Mrs. Farnum,\" cried Virgie, leaning forward and seizing the woman's\n",
      "hands in a transport of joy, as she believed she was about to hear some\n",
      "definite news regarding her loved one, \"Sir William Heath is my\n",
      "husband--can you tell me anything about him? I have not heard a word from\n",
      "him for more than a month, and I am nearly distracted from anxiety and\n",
      "suspense.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Farnum drew back in well-feigned astonishment.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Child! are you mad? Sir William Heath your husband? It is simply\n",
      "impossible.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Virgie straightened herself, and yet it seemed as if somebody had suddenly\n",
      "struck her a cruel blow upon her naked heart.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Farnum had just told her that for years she had been the most\n",
      "intimate friend of Lady Linton and yet to all appearances she had been\n",
      "literally astounded to learn that Sir William was married.\n",
      "\n",
      "Could it be possible that her husband had never acknowledged her as his\n",
      "wife to his family?\n",
      "\n",
      "The thought almost paralyzed her for a moment; then she put it indignantly\n",
      "away from her.\n",
      "\n",
      "No, he had written letter after letter to his mother and sister--at least\n",
      "he had spoken of so doing, though she had never read them--telling of\n",
      "their marriage, and speaking of their return to Heathdale. Of course his\n",
      "friends must have been apprised of all that had occurred during his\n",
      "absence; still it was very strange that the \"most intimate acquaintance of\n",
      "Lady Linton\" had not been made acquainted with the fact.\n",
      "\n",
      "All at once, however, she brightened. Mrs. Farnum had been traveling in\n",
      "America also, for how long she did not know, and perhaps that accounted\n",
      "for it. If she did not correspond with Lady Linton she had no means of\n",
      "knowing of the baronet's marriage.\n",
      "\n",
      "She even smiled to think how foolish she had been to allow such thoughts\n",
      "to have even for a moment a place in her mind, as she looked up and said:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, indeed, Mrs. Farnum, I am not mad, and it is not impossible that I am\n",
      "Sir William Heath's wife. We were married last September, and after the\n",
      "death of my father, who was very ill at the time, we traveled for several\n",
      "months and then came to New York, intending to sail for England the last\n",
      "of May, but were forbidden to do so by my physician, as I have already\n",
      "told you.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Still I say it is impossible. The Sir William Heath whom I mean is the\n",
      "master of a large estate called Heathdale in Hampshire County, England,\"\n",
      "reiterated Mrs. Farnum, decisively.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And my husband is the master of Heathdale, in Hampshire County, England,\"\n",
      "Virgie said, a trifle proudly.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",

      "\n",
      "Mrs. Farnum took it, and examined the envelope. It was directed to \"Mrs.\n",
      "William Heath,----Hotel, New York City, U.S.A.\" It was post-marked at\n",
      "Heathdale. The handwriting was familiar, and she knew well enough that\n",
      "Sir William Heath had penned it.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Mrs. William Heath!\" she said, reading the name aloud. \"He does not\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Oh!\" cried Virgie, with a shiver of pain, for those last words, implying\n",

      "conspicuous while we were traveling, so my husband dropped his title,\" she\n",
      "explained.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Ahem! that was a very strange proceeding. But does--does he say anything\n",

      "\n",
      "\"You may read it if you like, Mrs. Farnum. I see that you are still in\n",

      "\n",
      "She did not finish what she was going to say, but coolly drew the letter\n",
      "from the envelope, unfolded, and began to read it, never once stopping to\n",
      "consider how she was outraging the delicacy and affection of the young\n",
      "wife by this act, notwithstanding that she had received permission to do\n",
      "so--She could not doubt, as she read, that the young baronet's heart had\n",
      "all been given to this fair, beautiful woman, for though written in his\n",
      "own dignified way, the letter was full of devotion and loyalty to her. And\n",
      "yet not once in all those eight pages had he called her by the sacred name\n",
      "of \"wife.\" There were all manner of pet names and expressions of\n",

      "proved so much.\n",
      "\n",
      "The arch plotter as she read, was quick to observe this omission, and she\n",
      "gloated over it; it would materially help to further her designs in the\n",
      "future she thought, if this letter was a sample of all others which he had\n",

      "\n",

      "\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Pray, be calm, my child,\" she returned, with a pitiful accent. \"Sit down\n",
      "beside me here, and I will explain why I am so disturbed. Good heavens! we\n",
      "have always supposed that Sir William was a man of unblemished honor.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Madam, be careful how you speak of my husband!\" Virgie interrupted,\n",
      "haughtily, yet with a note of agony in her voice. \"Sir William is an\n",
      "honorable man, and I will not allow you to say one word against him in my\n",
      "presence.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Poor child! poor child! I fear you have been terribly deceived. How can\n",

      "every appearance of distress.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You <i>shall</i> tell me instantly. I will not stand here and listen to such\n",
      "paralyzing insinuations. <i>If</i> you have any thing to tell me, say it at\n",
      "once, and do not keep me in this maddening suspense!\" Virgie commanded\n",
      "grasping the woman by the wrist, and transfixing her with her blazing\n",
      "eyes.\n",
      "\n",
      "If Sir William Heath could have seen her at that moment he would have been\n",
      "very proud of her, for she had never been so beautiful, although a\n",
      "terrible agony was stamped upon her white, imperious face.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I can only repeat what I have already said. It is impossible. You will\n",
      "never be mistress of Heathdale!\" reiterated Mrs. Farnum, in an inflexible\n",
      "voice, as she disengaged her wrist from Virgie's grasp, which had left the\n",
      "imprint of every finger upon it.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Go on!\" commanded the young wife, authoritatively \"You have simply made a\n",
      "statement. You must confirm it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Because,\" proceeded the relentless woman, \"in the first place, if you are\n",
      "his wife, he would long before this have acknowledged you as such to his\n",
      "friends.\"\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Did you see him <i>post</i> his letter?\" inquired Mrs. Farnum, quietly, but in\n",
      "a tone that keenly stung the sensitive girl before her.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No,\" she replied, a hot flush mounting to her brow; \"but I know he did.\n",
      "He is to honorable to dissemble.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Did you ever see any reply to his communication in which his friends\n",
      "recognized the fact of your marriage?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No. I--I never questioned him,\" Virgie answered, with white lips. \"My\n",

      "anything else.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But of course you have your marriage certificate. That would prove\n",

      "that she had not.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"My husband has it.\"\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Madam, can you not see that you are driving me mad?\" cried Virgie, in an\n",
      "agonized voice. \"You have heard something; you are concealing something\n",
      "from me. For mercy's sake, make an end of this suspense!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Answer me one question more. Were there witnesses at your marriage?\"\n",

      "\"Yes, four.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Four! Who were they?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Farnum asked this question in a somewhat disappointed tone, for if\n",
      "the young wife could bring four witnesses to prove her marriage, Lady\n",
      "Linton might well tremble for the success of her plots, though Nevada was\n",
      "a long distance from England, and there might be some difficulty in\n",
      "producing them.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"My father\"--a sob checked Virgie's utterance as she mentioned him, and\n",

      "performed the ceremony, a woman who lived near us, and our own servant.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Then, since you have no tangible proof in your own hands that you are Sir\n",

      "witnesses without delay, since their testimony alone will serve to\n",
      "establish your rights and--those of your child,\" Mrs. Farnum said, with a\n",
      "solemnity that struck a fearful chill to Virgie's heart.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"My child!\"\n",

      "\n",
      "Was it possible that anything was threatening the honor and future\n",
      "happiness of her child, who, next to its father, was at once her pride and\n",
      "idol?\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh!\" she cried, pressing her hands to her throbbing temples, \"why will\n",
      "you talk so in riddles? If you have anything to tell me, in pity speak out\n",
      "before I lose my reason!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Wait one moment, and I will bring you a letter which I have recently\n",
      "received, and when I have read it to you, you will understand why I have\n",
      "been so skeptical regarding what you have told me, and why I have\n",
      "questioned you so closely.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "With these words, Mrs. Farnum arose and left the room, while Virgie,\n",
      "almost stunned by the fearful suspicions which had been so artfully thrust\n",
      "upon her, and feeling almost as if a knife had been driven through her\n",
      "heart, sank nerveless and trembling into a chair to await her return.\n",
      "\n",
      "The relentless woman was not gone long. The ice was thoroughly broken at\n",

      "written to her that her brother was becoming very impatient at being\n",
      "detained so long from his wife; he was nearly ill from anxiety because he\n",
      "did not hear from her, and she feared he would soon brave everything and\n",
      "go to her; so whatever was done to separate them eventually, must be\n",
      "quickly done.\n",
      "\n",
      "She soon returned, holding in her hand a letter, and a lurid light burned\n",
      "in her eyes as she glanced at the stricken wife saw how well her blows had\n",
      "told.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"This letter,\" she began, seating herself, and drawing some closely\n",

      "I read, that my authority for what I have told you is indisputable.\n",

      "\"Very well; then, I will read it to you; but, my young friend, you must be\n",

      "Virgie opened her lips as if to speak, but the words died on them, and\n",
      "Mrs. Farnum began:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"My Dear Myra:--You will be glad to learn that mamma is really\n",
      "better--not, of course, as far on the road to convalescence as we could\n",
      "desire, but comfortable enough to have had the wedding take place as\n",
      "appointed It would have been too bad if it had to be postponed; so\n",
      "unlucky, you know. We thought once that we should have to put it off\n",
      "indefinitely; but, as mamma could not bear the thought, and Sir Herbert\n",
      "consenting, provided there should be no excitement, we decided not to\n",
      "disarrange the long-talked-of plans. Will and Margie both behaved\n",
      "beautifully, and declared they would cheerfully defer everything if mamma\n",
      "was likely to suffer from it; but it was very evident that their happiness\n",
      "was greatly augmented when told that it would not be necessary. The\n",
      "wedding occurred on the 28th, in the Heath chapel. It was, of course, very\n",
      "quiet and unassuming, though the bride was lovely in her robe of white\n",
      "satin, exquisitely decorated with Chantilly lace, and wreath of heath,\n",
      "which it has always been the custom for the brides of the house to wear.\n",
      "William looked as noble as ever, and our good old rector made the service\n",
      "very impressive not forgetting to mention in his prayer, most touchingly,\n",
      "her who lay ill at home and could not grace with her presence the glad\n",
      "occasion. There was a very quiet breakfast afterward at Mrs. Stanhope's,\n",
      "after which Will and Margie came over for mamma's congratulations and\n",
      "blessing.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"They are not going on a journey just now. They will visit London for a\n",
      "few days, and then return here and remain at home for the present. Will\n",
      "seems almost like a boy in his happiness, while Margie is sweeter and\n",
      "prettier than ever. Of course we are all delighted, for we have always\n",
      "been so pleased at the prospect of the match, though I was afraid for a\n",
      "little while that something might happen. I feared there had been some\n",
      "nonsense when William was in America for I came across the photograph of\n",
      "the loveliest face I ever saw, one day, while looking over and arranging\n",
      "his wardrobe after his return. But the old saying proves true--'All's well\n",
      "that ends well,' and I trust there is a brilliant future for the master of\n",

      "positively alarmed at the result of her work.\n",
      "\n",
      "She sat like a statue, scarce seeming to breathe; there was not the\n",
      "slightest color in her face or lips, and the expression of agony about her\n",
      "mouth reveiled something of the fearful suffering she was enduring, while\n",
      "there was a look in her eyes which her companion never forgot.\n",
      "\n",
      "She did not move for several minutes after Mrs. Farnum ceased reading; it\n",

      "\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Why, of William Heath, of course,\" returned Mrs. Farnum, greatly relieved\n",
      "to hear her speak once more, \"and I have known him all my life. I used to\n",
      "visit at Heathdale a great deal before Lady Linton's marriage, and he was\n",
      "always a favorite of mine. He was a bright, manly fellow, and his friends\n",
      "have planned great things for him. I--I can hardly credit what you have\n",
      "told me to-day. I did not dream he could do anything so wrong; but\n",
      "doubtless he will settle down now, and I shall expect to see him a member\n",
      "of Parliament; he has everything in his favor.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Who is--Margie?\" Virgie asked, in the same tone as before, though she had\n",
      "shivered at the last words of Mrs. Farnum; they were bitterly cruel.\n",

      "\"Why, Margaret Stanhope--one of the loveliest girls in Hampshire County.\n",

      "\"Oh!\" gasped Virgie, clasping her hands over her aching heart, and for a\n",

      "envelop her.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Farnum thought she was going to faint; but the weakness passed, and\n",

      "since his return to England, then the greatest wrong that ever was\n",
      "perpetrated has been done, and he has made a dupe of her and--broken my\n",
      "heart. As sure as there is a just God, I am Sir William Heath's lawful\n",

      "\n",
      "Then when Sir William should search for her, as of course she knew he\n",
      "would do, and fail to find her, he could easily be made to believe that\n",
      "she had been untrue, and fled from him; a divorce could be readily\n",
      "obtained to set him free, and thus Sadie, if she played her cards aright,\n",
      "might yet become the mistress of Heathdale.\n",
      "\n",
      "But the injured wife's project of going to face her recreant husband, and\n",
      "demanding to be acknowledged as the lawful mistress of Heathdale, must be\n",
      "defeated at any cost, and the wily woman immediately set about\n",
      "accomplishing her object.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Ah, my poor child!\" she began, assuming a sympathetic tone, \"one cannot\n",
      "blame you for just indignation at having been so deeply wronged. I never\n",
      "would have believed Sir William capable of such dishonor. But surely you\n",
      "will never think of subjecting yourself to an ordeal so terrible as that\n",
      "you have just proposed.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why should I not? Why should I shrink from anything that will right this\n",
      "wrong? Nothing can hurt me more than I have been hurt to-day,\" Virgie\n",
      "answered, spiritedly, yet with inconceivable bitterness.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But think of Sir William's family. They are exceedingly sensitive and\n",
      "proud spirited, and they would never tolerate your claim for an instant;\n",
      "no shadow of dishonor has ever touched them in any way, and they would not\n",
      "endure the scandal.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Think of Sir William's family! Why should I consider them? Madam, it is\n",
      "myself of whom I have to think--myself and my innocent little one; and do\n",
      "you suppose I will tolerate the indignity which has been offered me? Is\n",
      "not my good name and that of my child as much at stake, and of as much\n",
      "value as the name of Heath?\" Virgie cried, her proud spirit blazing forth\n",
      "in righteous indignation.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But Sir William is a peer of the realm.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"A peer!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Farnum actually cringed beneath the scorn that rang out in the young\n",
      "wife's tone as she repeated these words:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And are peers of the realm exempt from all dishonor when they violate\n",
      "every law, both human and divine?\" she continued, with stinging sarcasm.\n",
      "\"Does the code of your nobility provide that young and innocent girls, who\n",
      "are basely betrayed, shall sit tamely down and meekly bear their injuries,\n",
      "so that your peers of the realm can go unscathed? If so, thank heaven that\n",
      "your laws do not prevail in this country. You are yourself a mother--you\n",
      "are proud of your beautiful daughter; but think you if she stood in my\n",
      "place you would advise her to consider the feelings of Sir William's\n",
      "family, to ignore her rights, and shut her eyes to her own injuries, lest\n",
      "she cast a shadow of dishonor upon their proud escutcheon? And do you\n",
      "think that I am less of a woman than she--that I am devoid of fine\n",
      "sensibilities, of pride and self-respect?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Farnum had winced as under a lash during all this spirited speech.\n",
      "Its scorn and sarcasm stung her keenly, and made her very angry. She\n",
      "longed to revenge herself upon the proud girl who had presumed to rank\n",
      "herself along with her daughter, by proclaiming the secret regarding her\n",
      "life, which she had so cunningly learned in San Francisco.\n",
      "\n",
      "But she feared to arouse her further. She realized that she must seek to\n",
      "conciliate her, and try to persuade her not to take the mad journey to\n",
      "England which she seemed so bent upon.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, no, my poor child,\" she began, soothingly; \"you do not realize what\n",
      "you are saying. Of course, I know it is all very wrong to deceive a girl\n",
      "in any such way, be she high or low, rich or poor. But just consider how\n",
      "you are situated. You say that your hus--that Sir William has your\n",
      "marriage certificate, and you have nothing to prove your statements with,\n",
      "even if you should present yourself at Heathdale. How do you suppose you\n",
      "would be received there if you should burst in upon them claiming to be\n",
      "Sir William's wife and the mistress of Heathdale if you could not\n",
      "substantiate your statements? My dear, it would be the blindest folly.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But I have his letters!\" cried Virgie, eagerly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"True, you have his letters, and no doubt his handwriting would be\n",
      "instantly recognized by his family, But they could not prove your\n",
      "position, especially if they are all written after the style of the one\n",
      "which you allowed me to read this afternoon, for in all those pages not\n",
      "once does he speak of you as his wife. You must have something more\n",
      "tangible and conclusive than those,\" Mrs. Farnum asserted, confidently.\n",
      "\n",
      "All the light died out of Virgie's face as she began to see that there\n",
      "were terrible difficulties in the way of proving that she was a lawfully\n",
      "wedded wife.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I have my ring,\" she said, weakly, and holding up the white, delicate\n",
      "hand on which the heavy circlet gleamed, guarded by a brilliant diamond,\n",
      "but which trembled like a reed shaken by the wind.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Is it marked with the date of your marriage?\" inquired Mrs. Farnum, an\n",
      "anxious gleam in her eye as it rested upon that symbol of wifehood.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"N-o; it was thoughtlessly neglected at the time, because there were so\n",
      "many other things to be attended to, and--and I could not bear to have it\n",
      "taken off to rectify the oversight, after it was once put upon my hand,\"\n",
      "Virgie confessed, growing white again even to her lips.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That was unwise, not to say foolish of you,\" said Mrs. Farnum,\n",
      "deprecatingly, but with a throb of exultation.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But,\" added Virgie, after thinking a moment, \"he brought me here as his\n",
      "wife. The proprietor of this hotel will tell you so. Dr. Knox, my\n",
      "physician, will tell you so also, as I was introduced to him by my husband\n",
      "as Mrs. Heath; and there are other people in the house who know it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Farnum smiled pitifully.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"My dear,\" she said, gravely, \"how many of these people do you think would\n",
      "be willing to swear that you are Sir William Heath's wife, if you should\n",
      "ask them to do so? How many would put their names to a paper certifying\n",
      "their honest conviction that you are, if told the title and position he\n",
      "occupies in his own country and <i>your history</i> in this?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Virgie started at these words, and would have asked the woman what she\n",
      "knew of her history, but she went on as if she had not remarked her\n",
      "emotion:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"If Sir William had brought you here as <i>Lady Heath,</i> registered himself\n",
      "in his own proper character, and taken you into society thus, there would\n",
      "have been no room for doubt. But instead, what <i>has</i> he done? It is very\n",
      "strange that your own suspicions have not been aroused by his actions. He\n",
      "has registered everywhere as plain 'William Heath and lady.' Instead of\n",
      "going to the public table, as most of the guests are in the habit of\n",
      "doing, he has paid extra rates to have your meals served in your own\n",
      "rooms, and kept you secluded from almost every one. What construction do\n",
      "you suppose would be put upon these facts, if they were submitted to\n",
      "people generally, if----\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But, Mrs. Farnum, all this was done out of regard for my feelings. I told\n",
      "you that we did not wish to be conspicuous while traveling, so my husband\n",
      "dropped his title. I could not go into society here, and I did not like\n",
      "to go to the public table where I should be--obliged to meet so many\n",
      "strangers,\" Virgie interrupted, a hot flush rising to her brow, while\n",
      "there was a weary, hunted look, in her eyes as the cunning woman continued\n",
      "to weave her tangled web about her.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Of course, <i>I</i> can understand all that,\" replied Mrs. Farnum,\n",
      "indulgently, \"but how would it appear as evidence if brought up in\n",
      "connection with your efforts to prove yourself a lawful wife?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Virgie's heart sank.\n",
      "\n",
      "Turned which way she would, everything, as argued and distorted by her\n",
      "companion, appeared against her, and for a moment it seemed as if her\n",
      "spirit was crushed within her.\n",
      "\n",
      "But at that instant a little cry from the adjoining room fell upon her\n",
      "ears, and immediately all her natural pride and energy returned to her\n",
      "aid.\n",
      "\n",
      "She straightened herself and lifted her head proudly a look of firm\n",
      "resolve settling upon her face and gleaming in her eyes.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"There are proofs,\" she said, in a low, firm tone, \"even though I have not\n",
      "my marriage certificate and though some people may doubt the truth of what\n",
      "I assert, and--I will yet have them. My father, who would have been my\n",
      "strongest helper, is dead, but there are three other witnesses living who\n",
      "can swear that I am a lawful wife. There must be records also, and, madam,\n",
      "I will move heaven and earth to establish my rightful position in life.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Farnum trembled before this indomitable resolution.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And would you be willing to occupy it, even if you could establish it?\"\n",
      "she asked, with a covert sneer, \"would you force yourself into a position\n",
      "which, appearances go to prove, was never intended to be given to you?\n",
      "Would you force yourself upon a man who had subjected you to the indignity\n",
      "of repudiating you as a wife and put another in your place?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Virgie's head reeled beneath the force of these cruel questions, and she\n",
      "swayed dizzily, as if about to fall, for a moment.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then again with a mighty effort she recovered herself.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No,\" she cried, her beautiful lips curling with, scorn, every pulse in\n",
      "her body throbbing with contempt \"the chosen mistress of Heathdale may\n",
      "keep her position after I have proven my right to it, if she prizes it\n",
      "enough to pay the price of her own dishonor; but my child is also the\n",
      "lawful child of Sir William Heath--she is the heiress to all his\n",
      "possessions and she shall yet occupy the place in the world that\n",
      "rightfully belongs to her, no matter who else may stand in her path. It\n",
      "may take time to accomplish all this, but, mark me, Mrs. Farnum, and tell\n",
      "your 'proud, unimpeachable family' at Heathdale so, if you choose, it\n",
      "shall be accomplished.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Then of course you will not be able to sail immediately for England as\n",
      "you at first proposed to do,\" returned Mrs. Farnum, her heart leaping with\n",
      "joy as Virgie's words told her that she had changed her mind regarding her\n",
      "first threat.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, I can see, now I come to consider the matter, that it would be folly\n",
      "for me to attempt to gain my rights without being armed with positive\n",
      "proof of what I assert. It exists, however, though it will necessitate\n",
      "much trouble and expense to secure it. Three months hence, however, I\n",
      "shall hope to have it in my hands, then, let your 'peer of the realm' and\n",
      "his 'honored family' take warning, for a righteous judgment will surely\n",
      "overtake them for the wrong which I suffer to-day. Now go--leave me if you\n",
      "please; you may have meant well in telling me what you have, but, oh! you\n",
      "have ruined my life and all my hopes,\" Virgie concluded, with a moan and\n",
      "gesture full of despair.\n",
      "\n",
      "Her strength was failing her; the bitterness of death was upon her and she\n",
      "longed to be alone, for she could not endure that any one should witness\n",
      "her cruel humiliation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Her last words had galled Mrs. Farnum almost beyond endurance; no doubt\n",
      "because she realized that there was so much truth in them, while her\n",
      "threat regarding a righteous judgment overtaking the family at Heathdale\n",
      "caused her heart to sink with a sudden dread of disgraceful punishment for\n",
      "herself if ever her complicity in this foul plot should be discovered.\n",
      "\n",
      "She arose, cold and stern.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"<i>I</i> ruin your life, indeed!\" she answered, haughtily. \"I think you have\n",
      "no one to thank for that but yourself, for having lent a too willing ear\n",
      "to the flattering tongue of a strange young man.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "She swept from the room with a firm step and uplifted head, while Virgie\n",

      "\n",
      "He was three years older than the young baronet, and had been named for\n",

      "son was born to the elder Sir William. But this was not to be.\n",

      "From childhood the boy had been attached to his little, neighbor and\n",

      "\n",
      "But being the son of a younger son, he had had to struggle somewhat for\n",

      "to Sir William's return from America that he had succeeded in securing a\n",
      "situation as private secretary to a nobleman, and thus felt that at last\n",
      "he had a right to marry the sweet girl whom he had so long and so fondly\n",

      "\n",
      "The marriage had been set for the 28th of June, but Lady Heath's sudden\n",

      "when she began to improve, and the question being submitted to her, she,\n",
      "having a great fondness for both her nephew and his betrothed, had\n",
      "insisted that the marriage should proceed. It accordingly took place in\n",
      "the chapel at Heathdale, Sir William himself giving away the bride, as her\n",

      "indeed, I cannot understand a good many things that have come to me\n",
      "through you. If Sir William Heath has wilfully done me this irreparable\n",

      "paltry hundred pounds when he has a fortune in his hands belonging to me.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"A fortune! I did not suppose--I did not know that you had any money,\"\n",
      "stammered Mrs. Farnum, looking blank.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"My father left me a good many thousands of dollars when he died; it was\n",
      "all settled upon me at the time of my marriage, but Sir William Heath took\n",
      "charge of it and has it now. He deposited five thousand dollars in a bank\n",
      "here for my use, while he should be away, and the most of that remains;\n",
      "but there is much more that rightly belongs to me,\" Virgie explained.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Then this hundred pounds surely is your due,\" Mrs. Farnum said, as she\n",
      "drew it from the envelope and held it out to the young wife.\n",
      "\n",
      "Virgie drew back haughtily.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Do you suppose that I would accept as charity a paltry sum like\n",
      "that?--for Lady Linton sent it as such, and as a sort of remuneration for\n",
      "what I suffer. It is an outrage which I cannot brook, and I am amazed at\n",
      "the audacity that prompted it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "So was Mrs. Farnum amazed, and she saw at once that Lady Linton had\n",
      "unwittingly committed a great blunder. She had never dreamed that Virgie\n",
      "had had money at the time of her marriage, and she imagined that Lady\n",
      "Linton was also ignorant that her brother had taken back to England a\n",
      "fortune belonging to the girl whom they were thus seeking to wrong.\n",
      "\n",
      "Matters were getting complicated, and she almost wished that she had never\n",
      "allowed herself to become involved in them.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You should have kept your marriage certificate,\" she faltered, \"every\n",
      "wife should do that--then you could have proved your claim.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I shall prove it yet,\" Virgie declared, in a clear, decisive voice. \"Do\n",
      "you imagine I am going to sit tamely down and allow a stigma to rest upon\n",
      "this innocent child if there is any power on earth to prevent it? In spite\n",
      "of all that you have told me, or all that your friends have written, I\n",
      "<i>know</i> that I am Sir William Heath's lawful wife. If he committed a rash\n",
      "and impulsive act, and one which he regrets now, while he was in America\n",
      "and while he was bound by other ties in England <i>he</i> must suffer the\n",
      "consequences. I cannot understand how he has <i>dared</i> to perpetrate such a\n",
      "farce, were he a thousand times engaged to Miss Stanhope; how he has dared\n",
      "to so wrong and compromise one of his own countrywomen, for, just so sure\n",
      "as we both live, it will all be exposed sooner or later. All this I will\n",
      "do for the sake of my child; then----\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Then?\" repeated Mrs. Farnum, leaning eagerly toward the resolute girl.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Then <i>I</i> will repudiate <i>him</i>. I will never look upon his face again. I\n",
      "will give him his freedom--will divorce myself from him; and then, if the\n",
      "woman who now believes herself to be his wife wishes it, or will accept\n",
      "it, he can make the tie between them legal.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You will obtain a divorce?\" said her companion, with an exultant thrill.\n",
      "\n",
      "This was something she had never thought of before She and Lady Linton had\n",
      "both hoped to estrange this fond couple, then make Sir William believe in\n",
      "his wife's infidelity, and work upon his feelings and pride until he\n",
      "should be willing to seek a divorce; but they had never imagined that\n",
      "Virgie would be the one to suggest such a measure. Such a preceding on her\n",
      "part would wonderfully facilitate matters, and Mrs. Farnum, who a few\n",
      "minutes previous began to be disheartened, was greatly encouraged.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Exactly,\" Virgie replied. \"Do you imagine that I desire to hold Sir\n",
      "William Heath unwillingly bound to me? Do you think that I would ever have\n",
      "consented to become his wife if I had known that any one had a prior claim\n",
      "upon him? But, are you sure that he was engaged to Miss Stanhope before he\n",
      "came to America?\" the young wife asked, as doubt again arose in her mind.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes; Will and Margie have been betrothed for years--ten, at least, I\n",
      "should say. Did you not read it for yourself in Lady Linton's letter?\"\n",
      "Mrs. Farnum returned; but there was a vivid flush on her cheek as she\n",
      "told the wretched lie, even while she was literally speaking the truth.\n",
      "\n",
      "A convulsion of pain passed over Virgie's face.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"True; but it is all so strange,\" she said, wearily. \"And I suppose--she\n",
      "loves him?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I believe her life would be ruined if anything should happen to part\n",
      "them,\" said the woman, ruthlessly.\n",
      "\n",
      "Any icy shiver ran over Virgie from head to foot, and a low moan escaped\n",
      "her lips.\n",
      "\n",
      "No one cared for <i>her</i> ruined life; it was nothing that <i>she</i> was parted\n",
      "forever from the man she adored.\n",

      "\"I will not part them,\" she said, in a hollow tone; \"<i>but</i>--\"\n",

      "word, with a threatening intonation.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"A day of reckoning will surely come for him,\" Virgie answered, firmly;\n",
      "\"for, if this child lives, she will one day make her appearance at\n",
      "Heathdale and claim her heritage. There may be other children, but she\n",
      "will have the first right there. Tell your Lady Linton this--tell her that\n",
      "'that girl,' of whom she wrote so slightingly and heartlessly, will live\n",
      "to educate her child for her position as the mistress of her 'proud\n",

      "will not fail to overtake him.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Virgie was regally beautiful as she stood there before her enemy and\n",
      "pronounced this stern prophecy. There was not an atom of color in her\n",
      "face, but her figure was drawn proudly erect, a sort of majesty in every\n",
      "graceful curve, while there was a resolute, inflexible purpose in every\n",
      "line of her beautiful features, and her eyes burned with a steady,\n",
      "relentless fire which told that, if she lived, she would accomplish her\n",
      "vow, let the cost be what it would.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Farnum, woman of the world though she was, felt cowed and abashed\n",
      "before her, and when, without waiting for a reply, the wronged wife turned\n",
      "from her and walked, with a firm, unfaltering step, into her chamber,\n",
      "shutting the door after her, she slunk away to her own room, feeling like\n",
      "the guilty thing she was, and trembling for the future if it should ever\n",
      "be discovered what part she had played in the plot to ruin Virginia\n",

      "\n",
      "But she had not taken into consideration the fact that Virgie's child\n",

      "not trouble herself about future developments. But that pale, beautiful\n",
      "face, with that resolute yet heart-broken look upon it, haunted her for\n",

      "the cause of his wife's long silence.\n",
      "\n",

      "\"But you have had no letters for a long time; the gentleman has for years\n",
      "been engaged to an English lady; this paper gives a notice of his recent\n",
      "marriage to her, and everything goes to prove that you have been grossly\n",
      "deceived. It is very unfortunate, but I have received notice from several\n",
      "of my guests that they will leave to-morrow morning unless I insist upon\n",
      "this change, and thus it becomes my painful duty to request these rooms to\n",
      "be vacated.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "This was a bitter blow to add to all the rest, but Virgie, conscious of\n",
      "her own purity, bore it with Spartan-like heroism.\n",
      "\n",
      "She cast one look of scorn upon the man before her, then said, with a\n",

      "\n",
      "\"No; and I am nearly wild with anxiety. I <i>must</i> go to Virgie at once,\"\n",

      "\"Why don't you cable, then? I am going in town this morning, and I will\n",
      "send a message for you, if you wish,\" craftily suggested his sister, who\n",
      "felt very uncomfortable at the thought of his starting off so suddenly:\n",

      "to crown her plans.\n",
      "\n",
      "She had heard from Mrs. Farnum only once since her <i>coup d'etat,</i> when she\n",

      "The letter had been posted that same day, for the woman had not hoped that\n",
      "Virgie would leave the house so quickly, even though she knew she was\n",
      "going to be asked to do so; and as she knew her friend would be anxious to\n",

      "Excitement and anxiety had destroyed her appetite.\n",
      "\n",
      "Two or three times every week, of late, there had been just such a scene\n",

      "\n",
      "No letters came from Virgie. At least, <i>he</i> received none; for they were\n",

      "so, of course was unsuspicious of any plot.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was simply unaccountable to him, and he was, as he said, almost wild\n",
      "from anxiety on account of his dear ones.\n",
      "\n",
      "He could not touch his food this morning, his disappointment was so great,\n",

      "\n",
      "\"The Cephalonia will sail on Saturday,\" he remarked, at length. \"This is\n",

      "another week.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Very well; I will do my best to keep her cheerful while you are gone,\"\n",
      "returned Lady Linton, trying to appear at ease, although she was quaking\n",
      "in mortal fear lest all her plotting should come to naught.\n",
      "\n",
      "She sometimes regretted having written that last letter and sent that\n",
      "hundred pounds to Virgie. She began to fear that she might have\n",
      "overreached herself by so doing, for, if her brother and his wife should\n",
      "meet, Virgie would of course tell her husband everything, and he would at\n",
      "once understand that his sister had been guilty of all the\n",
      "mischief--intercepted letters, and all. She knew that he would never\n",
      "forgive her; she would be ignominiously banished from Heathdale, and be\n",
      "obliged to hide herself at Linton Grange, where she would lead a life of\n",
      "poverty and seclusion; so it is not strange that she trembled at the\n",
      "thought of Sir William sailing for America.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Shall you return at once?\" she asked, as they arose from the table.\n",

      "\n",
      "\"You will mention, too, for <i>whom</i> they are being prepared,\" Sir William\n",
      "said, glancing sharply at his sister. \"It must be known at once that I\n",

      "persuade me to keep silence upon the subject so long.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But it was for mamma's sake, you know; while she was so ill it was better\n",
      "not to have it talked about,\" apologized Lady Linton; but she mentally\n",
      "resolved that she should be in no hurry to tell the secret, even if he had\n",
      "ordered her to do so, at least until she was sure her brother would find\n",
      "his wife.\n",
      "\n",
      "Something might prevent his bringing Virgie home, and in that case a\n",
      "scandal would be avoided if she kept silence. She would wait, at least,\n",
      "until he notified her of the date of his return.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It was a mistake, I tell you,\" Sir William repeated, with a clouded\n",
      "brow. \"It has been a mark of disloyalty to my wife which I will tolerate\n",
      "no longer. So please do as I request.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Lady Linton bowed.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Shall I cable for you?\" she asked, after a moment of silence. \"I shall be\n",
      "in London most of the day, and perhaps I may be able to get a reply to\n",
      "bring you on my return.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, thanks; I, too, shall go in town to-day, to engage my passage, and I\n",
      "will attend to the matter myself,\" Sir William replied, and the heart of\n",
      "the schemer sank within her.\n",
      "\n",
      "She had intended to cable to Mrs. Farnum, and, if Virgie was still at the\n",
      "hotel, authorize her to use any strategy to get her away before her\n",
      "brother should arrive, and then send her a dispatch to suit the emergency.\n",
      "\n",
      "But, if he cabled himself, and received an answer from his wife, she had\n",
      "the very worst to fear for herself.\n",
      "\n",
      "They went up to London on the same train, and Lady Linton suffered agonies\n",
      "during that ride, and all day long, while she was shopping, her suspense\n",
      "was terrible to her.\n",
      "\n",
      "But when she entered the station, late in the afternoon, to return to\n",
      "Heathdale, she was both startled and relieved to find her brother already\n",
      "there, and pacing back and forth outside the waiting-room in great\n",
      "excitement.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Have you news, William?\" she faltered, her heart beating almost to\n",
      "suffocation.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes,\" he answered, in a strained unnatural tone. \"Here, read this!\" and\n",
      "he thrust a cablegram into her trembling hands.\n",

      "\n",
      "\"And have you no idea whither my wife went after leaving here?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No,\" Mr. Eldridge said. \"I offered to find some nice, quiet place for\n",
      "her, but she simply thanked me and declined my offer. She then ordered a\n",
      "carriage and drove away, without giving any definite directions regarding\n",
      "her destination--at least, in my hearing.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The proprietor was careful not to state that he had been so relieved by\n",

      "that gentleman knew nothing whatever of what had occurred, and appeared\n",

      "\n",
      "He simply stated what we already knew--that Mrs. Heath had sent him a note\n",
      "saying that she was about leaving the city and wished to settle her bill,\n",
      "and requested him to call for the amount. He had done so, and she had paid\n",

      "\n",
      "He said that his time was limited, and he had only remained a few moments.\n",
      "He thought she was looking rather pale and worn; but she said she was\n",
      "well, and, being calm and self-possessed, he did not imagine that she was\n",
      "in any trouble.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was evident that from this source Sir William could gain nothing to aid\n",
      "him in his search for his wife.\n",
      "\n",
      "He then tried to discover the nurse who had been with her, but she was not\n",
      "to be found at her usual address, and no one could tell him anything about\n",
      "her.\n",
      "\n",
      "He went to the bank where he had deposited money for Virgie's use, but\n",
      "disappointment awaited him here also. He was told that she had sent word\n",
      "one morning that on a certain day she would need the whole amount due her.\n",
      "She had called according to her appointment, receiving her money, and that\n",
      "was all that was known there regarding her movements.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sir William was in despair. Failure met him on every hand, and he feared\n",
      "the worst for his loved ones.\n",
      "\n",
      "He remained in New York for more than a month, searching the city from end\n",
      "to end, employing detectives advertising in the papers, and using every\n",
      "means he could think of to gain some clew to Virgie's hiding-place; but\n",
      "all to no purpose; and he finally came to the conclusion that she must\n",
      "have left the metropolis. But whither had she gone? He knew that she had\n",
      "not a friend on this side of the Rocky Mountains; it was all a strange\n",
      "country to her.\n",
      "\n",
      "Would she be likely to remain East and hide herself and her supposed shame\n",
      "in some obscure place, or would she wander back to the Pacific coast,\n",
      "where everything would be more familiar and home-like to her?\n",
      "\n",
      "These questions agitated his mind continually, and for a while he knew not\n",
      "which way to turn, while he was growing both weary and heart-sick with his\n",
      "fruitless search.\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally he decided that he would go again to her old home among the\n",
      "mountains of Nevada. He might possibly learn something of her there.\n",
      "\n",
      "He reached the place just a year from the day of his departure with\n",
      "Virgie, and a feeling of utter desolation, almost of despair, took\n",
      "possession of him as he wandered here and there over the familiar ground\n",
      "visiting the grave of Mr. Abbot, and peering in at the cottage where he\n",
      "had first met his love, but where only strange faces now met his gaze.\n",
      "\n",
      "Everything looked the same as when he left, but evidently no one knew\n",
      "anything about his wife; he learned that from the eager inquiries, which\n",
      "met him on every side, for the beautiful girl whom he had taken away with\n",
      "him.\n",
      "\n",
      "He answered and evaded them as well as he could, without betraying that he\n",
      "was in any trouble, but he was deeply disappointed to find that Chi Lu had\n",
      "left the place.\n",
      "\n",
      "He was told that he had left very suddenly, but came back after a time,\n",
      "when he disposed of his cabin that Sir William had given him, and then\n",
      "disappeared altogether.\n",
      "\n",
      "The baronet sought out Margery Follet, and was impressed the moment that\n",
      "he saw her that she had something on her mind.\n",
      "\n",
      "She eyed him with suspicion, seemed averse to holding any conversation\n",
      "with him, and never once inquired regarding his wife.\n",
      "\n",
      "This alone made the young baronet hope that she knew something of Virgie,\n",
      "for, having been at her wedding, and afterward assisted her in many ways\n",
      "during Mr. Abbott's last illness, it would have been but natural for her\n",
      "to wish to know something about her.\n",
      "\n",
      "By adroitly questioning her he became convinced of the truth of his\n",
      "suspicion, and finally he charged her outright with having recently seen\n",
      "his wife.\n",
      "\n",
      "The woman stammered, blushed, and finally assumed a defiant attitude, and\n",
      "Sir William was sure.\n",
      "\n",
      "He then told her something of his trouble, enjoining her to secrecy, and\n",
      "finally she confessed that one day Chi Lu had come to her and persuaded\n",
      "her to go with him before the county magistrate to sign a paper stating\n",
      "that she had been a witness to the marriage of Miss Abbot with Mr. Heath.\n",
      "Chi Lu had given her a handsome sum for her trouble and to keep silent\n",
      "about the matter afterward.\n",
      "\n",
      "This confession gave Sir William great hope. It told him that Virgie had\n",
      "been in that vicinity; that she was gathering what proofs she could toward\n",
      "establishing the legality of her marriage, with a view to claiming her\n",
      "rights as a lawful wife.\n",
      "\n",
      "He was very much elated over the discovery, and at once repaired to the\n",
      "county town, to seek out the magistrate and learn what he could from him.\n",
      "\n",
      "That gentleman confirmed what he had already learned. He said that several\n",
      "weeks previous a young woman had come there to obtain a copy of the record\n",
      "of a certain marriage, and that afterward a Chinaman and an elderly woman\n",
      "had signed a paper in his presence, testifying to having been witnesses of\n",
      "the ceremony.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sir William reasoned that, since Virgie was seeking all these proofs, she\n",
      "would doubtless apply to the clergyman who had married them; so to\n",
      "Virginia City he straightway hastened, to seek the Rev. Dr. Thornton.\n",
      "\n",
      "He found him readily enough. The clergyman appeared to be in feeble\n",
      "health, and received him with coldness and evident displeasure.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I suppose you are somewhat at a loss how to account for my visit, Dr.\n",
      "Thornton,\" he remarked, in his genial way, and ignoring the frigidness of\n",
      "his host's greeting; \"but I have come to make some important inquiries of\n",
      "you.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The reverend gentleman simply bowed, and then waited for his guest to\n",
      "proceed.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You will be surprised that I have lost my wife and am searching for her,\"\n",
      "the baronet continued, thinking it best to come to the point at once.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Which one?\" demanded the divine, with an accent of scorn in his usually\n",
      "mild tones.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Sir!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"For which wife are you searching?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I have but one wife--the lady to whom you married me only a little more\n",
      "than a year ago!\" Sir William replied in a voice of thunder, his handsome\n",
      "face flaming with righteous anger, though his heart bounded with new hope\n",
      "at the question.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I beg your pardon, sir,\" the clergyman replied, seeing at once that there\n",
      "was some mystery, and there must have been some fearful mistake to cause\n",
      "the separation of these two young people in whom he had been so deeply\n",
      "interested.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You will understand my untimely sarcasm, perhaps,\" he went on, \"when I\n",
      "tell you that I have been led to believe that you had done that beautiful\n",
      "woman the greatest possible wrong.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He then proceeded to explain all that he knew of the matter.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Heath, he said, had come to him, about a month previous, to secure a\n",
      "written statement from him to the effect that he had performed the\n",
      "marriage ceremony in a legal and authorized manner between herself and Sir\n",
      "William Heath, of Heathdale, Hampshire County, England She was looking\n",
      "very sad and ill, and she confided to him that she had been deserted by\n",
      "her husband in New York; he having been called to his home by a cablegram,\n",
      "ostensibly because of his mother's illness, but that she had learned of\n",
      "his marriage with another lady in England, and she feared that his union\n",
      "with her might have been a farce. She had, however, learned to the\n",
      "contrary, and she was determined to gather all the proofs possible, for\n",
      "the purpose of securing the future rights and position of her child.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sir William Heath listened in painful silence to this recital, and then in\n",
      "turn related all that he knew regarding the terrible misunderstanding and\n",
      "the mystery attending it.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It looks to me very much as if there was a conspiracy in the matter, and\n",
      "a desire on the part of some one to separate you and your wife,\" Dr.\n",
      "Thornton remarked thoughtfully, when the young husband concluded.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"A conspiracy!\" repeated Sir William.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes; the fact that all letters, on both sides, have been intercepted,\n",
      "seems to point to such a suspicion. Have you any enemies who, from\n",
      "interested motives, would try to create trouble between you and your\n",
      "wife?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Not that I am aware of,\" the young man replied, but looking deeply\n",
      "perplexed. \"My family, to be sure, were not very well pleased with the\n",
      "idea of my marrying an American; but I can think of no one person who\n",
      "could have accomplished anything like what has occurred. It seems to me\n",
      "that in order to intercept our letters there would need to be conspirators\n",
      "on both sides of the Atlantic who were interested in the project.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Not necessarily. Any one determined to separate you might have robbed\n",
      "the mail of all letters at either end of the route. It is certainly very\n",
      "mysterious, and, mark my words, you will some day learn that an enemy has\n",
      "been at work. But, Sir William,\" the clergyman continued smiling genially,\n",
      "\"you have relieved my mind and established my faith in you by this\n",
      "explanation. I confess I had set you down as a miserable scamp, and I have\n",
      "suffered a good deal on that beautiful young woman's account.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I cannot blame you for thinking the very worst of me,\" returned Sir\n",
      "William, with emotion; \"but I have loved--I do love my wife with a love\n",
      "that can never die.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I do not doubt it now. Of course I gave her the paper she desired, and\n",
      "also a copy of the certificate which I presented you on your marriage day,\n",
      "and told her to command me at any time and I should be at her service to\n",
      "testify to the legality of her claims upon you.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Thank you, sir. I am truly grateful to you for your kindness to my poor\n",
      "darling,\" said the baronet, tears springing to his eyes. \"But can you give\n",
      "me any idea regarding her plans or movements?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, I cannot, I am sorry to say,\" returned Doctor Thornton. \"I asked her\n",
      "what course she intended to pursue, and she said, in the saddest voice I\n",
      "ever heard, 'I do not exactly know yet; I simply desire to establish the\n",
      "rightful claim of my daughter as the heiress of Heathdale.'\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That looks as if she meant to go immediately to England!\" cried Sir\n",
      "William, starting excitedly to his feet. \"If she should do that, all would\n",
      "be well--everything will be explained, and we shall be happy once more.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I cannot say that such was her plan,\" returned the clergyman,\n",
      "thoughtfully. \"She looked scarcely able to endure such a journey. Still,\n",
      "it may be that such was her intention.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, if I only knew! Just think, sir, I have never even seen my child!\"\n",
      "cried Sir William, greatly agitated.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It is certainly very sad. It is greatly to be regretted that you were\n",
      "recalled to England as you were,\" said Doctor Thornton.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Indeed it is. Why <i>did</i> I ever leave her? It was wrong! I fear I was\n",
      "negligent of my duty toward her in so doing. I do not know what to do now.\n",
      "If she has gone to England, we have passed each other, and I would desire\n",
      "to retrace my steps thither at once. If she is still here on this\n",
      "continent, I should be in despair to go home, and only find it out on the\n",
      "other side of the ocean.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Doctor Thornton pitied the young husband sincerely.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You are in a very trying position, I must acknowledge, and I do not like\n",
      "to advise you either to go or stay. You might wait here a while, and\n",
      "notify your friends to cable you in case Lady Heath should go direct to\n",
      "England; then it would be comparatively easy to join her there.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Sir William determined to act upon these suggestions. He would cable\n",
      "Heathdale to be notified if Virgie should make her appearance there;\n",
      "meantime he would do his utmost to find her here.\n",
      "\n",
      "He thanked the clergyman for his kindness, and bade him farewell, feeling\n",
      "much relieved regarding his wife, yet still very sad at heart at the\n",
      "mystery surrounding her.\n",
      "\n",
      "He determined to search for Chi Lu, believing that he alone, who had\n",
      "always been so devoted to her, could tell him something definite as to her\n",

      "\n",
      "He realized that underneath her habitual quiet and sweetness there lay a\n",

      "\n",

      "threats to claim her position, she began to fear that she had underrated\n",
      "the girl's spirit, and that she might make her appearance at any moment\n",
      "and demand to be received as the mistress of the house.\n",

      "This, of course, would make matters rather complicated and awkward; but,\n",

      "He thought right for once, had he but known it, and had he possessed a\n",

      "a note of agony in his voice: \"Oh, where can my darling have hidden\n",
      "herself? Miriam,\" turning suddenly upon his sister, \"can you suggest any\n",
      "reason for this terrible misunderstanding?--who could have intercepted all\n",
      "of our letters?--who could have conspired, for it seems like a conspiracy,\n",
      "to separate us?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "For a moment Lady Linton turned faint and sick with the fear that he had\n",
      "discovered something to arouse his suspicions against her; but second\n",
      "thought told her that such could not be the case.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What could I suggest?\" she demanded, assuming an expression of surprise.\n",
      "\"You forget that I know nothing of this woman who lured your heart from\n",
      "us, save what I have been told. She may have had a rustic lover who is\n",
      "seeking his revenge by trying to separate you--a lover who has poisoned\n",
      "her mind against you, and perhaps won her allegiance back to himself.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What utter nonsense you are talking, Miriam!\" the baronet interrupted,\n",
      "indignantly. \"How little you appreciate the refinement of the girl whom I\n",
      "have married! True, you have never seen her; but one look at the face that\n",

      "\n",
      "\"As for your letters,\" she said, flashing a swift, keen glance at him, \"if\n",
      "you think they have been tampered with on this side of the Atlantic, I\n",
      "advise you to question Robert, since he has the exclusive charge of your\n",
      "mail-bag.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Robert, indeed! I would as soon question my own honesty as his; besides,\n",
      "no one has a key to it but myself,\" Sir William asserted, confidently.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lady Linton breathed freely now, for it was evident that he had no\n",
      "suspicion of her.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"True; and Robert has been faithful too many years to be lightly\n",

      "\n",
      "\"But this suspense is insupportable! It is killing me!\" cried her brother,\n",
      "rising, and excitedly pacing the floor.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No doubt it is trying,\" his sister replied, coldly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Trying!\" he repeated, bitterly; \"you are very sympathetic, Miriam; you\n",
      "are as cold as ice.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, William, you know well enough that I never approved of your\n",
      "marriage. It was a great blow to both mamma and me that you should marry\n",
      "so out of your element; and therefore you cannot expect me to be so\n",
      "heart-broken over the mysterious disappearance of your wife as I might\n",
      "have been if you married--Sadie, for instance.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I wish you wouldn't throw Sadie Farnum at me upon every occasion; I never\n",

      "\"More is the pity; I could have loved her dearly as a sister,\" responded\n",
      "Lady Linton, in an injured tone. \"But,\" she added, after a thoughtful\n",
      "pause, \"it seems you were mistaken in thinking that your wife was\n",
      "collecting proofs of her marriage with the intention of coming here to\n",
      "claim her position. If that had been her plan, doubtless she would have\n",
      "been here long ago.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes--oh! I cannot understand it; but, if I ever discover <i>who</i> has been\n",
      "at the bottom of this mischief, it will be a sad day for that individual!\"\n",
      "cried the' baronet, with stern emphasis.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lady Linton suddenly stooped to brush a thread from her black dress, and\n",
      "when she sat upright again there was considerable more color than usual in\n",
      "her face.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I am troubled to see you so unhappy, William,\" she said, more kindly than\n",

      "\n",
      "\"I have none. I simply wish to get away from myself, if that is possible;\n",
      "to steep my troubled thoughts in some excitement. I believe I will go to\n",
      "the Far East--Egypt, Palestine--anywhere to escape this feeling of utter\n",
      "desolation,\" he answered, dejectedly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"When will you go?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"At once--before the week is out, if I can arrange to do so.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Have you any special commands for me to attend to during your absence?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"None, save that you are to remain here as usual, if you like, and in case\n",
      "any word comes from my loved ones, send for me at once.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Very well. Have you any idea how long you will be away?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No. I may not be gone a month; I may stay ten years; it will depend upon\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Oh, William, I wish you would try and rise above this trouble,\" said his\n",
      "sister, out of all patience with him at heart, but speaking in a soothing\n",
      "tone. \"I do not like to pain you, but, truly, it looks to me as if your\n",
      "wife had been guilty of willful desertion in thus hiding herself from you,\n",
      "and I believe there would be a great deal of happiness yet for you if you\n",
      "could be freed from her entirely, and then bring some good, gentle woman\n",
      "here to make your home pleasant for you.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "It was the first time that she had ever been able to gather courage\n",
      "sufficient to make this proposition; but she was wholly unprepared for the\n",
      "storm of wrath which the suggestion brought upon her head.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sir William came and stood, tall and stern, before her, his face almost\n",
      "convulsed with mingled pain and wrath, his eyes blazing dangerously:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Miriam Linton,\" he began, in a suppressed tone, \"never dare to open your\n",
      "lips on such a subject to me again. I married my darling for better or\n",
      "worse, until death should part us, and only my death or hers will ever\n",
      "break the tie--at least with my consent--that binds us.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He turned abruptly and left the room as he ceased speaking, more angry\n",
      "with her than he had ever been before.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lady Linton was thoroughly startled by what he had said, and she knew she\n",
      "would never dare suggest such a measure again to him; but she still had a\n",
      "secret hope, from what Mrs. Farnum had written her, that the injured wife\n",
      "would seek a legal separation from him.\n",
      "\n",
      "She imagined that this might be the reason of Virgie keeping so quiet just\n",
      "at present, and she was all the more willing and glad to have her brother\n",
      "go away from home, as he proposed doing, because she knew that he would\n",
      "have to be notified whenever any such proceedings should be instituted,\n",
      "and she feared if he were there to receive them he would at once post off\n",

      "So in less than a week Sir William left England for, Egypt and the Holy\n",

      "departure. Time, she reasoned, was a great healer, and she hoped much from\n",
      "this season of travel and change.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was rather lonely for her at Heathdale during the winter, but she was\n",
      "grateful to be released from the anxiety she had suffered on his account\n",
      "for the last year.\n",
      "\n",
      "Spring came, summer passed; a year had come and gone since the\n",
      "disappearance of her brother's young wife, when one day there came an\n",

      "California postmark.\n",

      "Lady Linton quivered in every nerve as she saw it, for her heart told her\n",
      "instantly what it contained.\n",

      "Still, she could not be satisfied until she knew beyond a doubt, and she\n",
      "skillfully opened it for examination before forwarding it to her brother.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was even as she had hoped.\n",
      "\n",
      "Virgie had kept her word; she was about to repudiate her husband for his\n",
      "supposed faithlessness to her, and Lady Linton's lips curled in a smile of\n",
      "exultation as she read the paper notifying her brother that proceedings\n",
      "for a divorce were about to be instituted in the courts of San Francisco\n",
      "by Lady Virginia Heath against Sir William Heath, of Heathsdale, England.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Everything is working beautifully,\" she murmured, triumphantly; \"his pride\n",

      "evidence to him that she, at least, desires to have the tie that binds\n",
      "them broken. Let me see! he is notified to appear on the ninth of next\n",
      "month--in a little more than four weeks. Ha, ha! he was in Alexandria when\n",
      "he last wrote, and this could not possibly reach him in season to admit of\n",

      "With a lighter heart than she had known for months, the crafty woman\n",
      "carefully resealed the document in a way to defy suspicion that it had\n",

      "\n",
      "She was filled with triumph over the success of all her plans thus far,\n",

      "Her brother might never consent to marry again--she feared he would\n",

      "She understood at once that he must have been nearly crushed upon\n",
      "receiving the document which she had sent him, and that he had immediately\n",
      "started for home. He must have been taken ill on the way and been detained\n",
      "else he would have been there before, and she could imagine how he would\n",

      "\n",
      "When he began to grow more calm, and to realize the comfort of being once\n",

      "fruitless search for Virgie, he had been far too sensitive upon the\n",
      "subject to talk of it himself, and thus almost everybody believed him to\n",

      "it was a plan on the part of Chi Lu to obtain funds to contribute toward\n",
      "her support when her own resources should fail. She knew that the\n",
      "little which he consented to receive from her was but a small\n",

      "\n",
      "During the next three months she applied herself diligently and as she\n",

      "there was a change for the better in her health and general appearance Her\n",
      "eye brightened, the lassitude that pervaded her movements disappeared and\n",
      "something of her old energy returned to her.\n",
      "\n",
      "She wasted no more time in useless brooding and pining; less tears were\n",
      "shed at night, for, wearied with her close application to her work during\n",
      "the day, sleep stole her senses and wrapped her in healthful rest.\n",
      "\n",
      "At the time appointed for all competitors to send in their designs, Virgie\n",
      "was ready to subject her work to criticism.\n",
      "\n",
      "She had made three designs, each differing in style and character from the\n",
      "others, but all so attractive that she felt almost sure they would bring\n",
      "her some return, even if she was not the fortunate winner of the prize.\n",
      "\n",
      "Besides these, she had been hard at work upon an idea of her own, which\n",

      "assistance in bringing it before the public.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dressing herself plainly, but with taste, she started out one morning with\n",
      "her treasures, and presenting herself at the publishing house referred to,\n",
      "asked to see the proprietor.\n",
      "\n",
      "The gentlemanly clerk led her to a private office, where she found a\n",
      "pleasant-looking, elderly gentleman who regarded her a trifle curiously,\n",
      "but greeted her courteously, and then politely asked her business with\n",
      "him.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Some time ago I saw an advertisement in your name, relating to Christmas\n",
      "souvenirs,\" Virgie began, \"and as this is the date on which they were\n",
      "required to be delivered I have brought my contribution for your\n",
      "inspection.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The gentleman bowed, but hesitated a moment before replying.\n",
      "\n",
      "Virgie's manner and language told him that she was a lady, and he did not\n",
      "like to say anything to wound her; but the advertisement to which she\n",
      "referred had distinctly stated that competitors were, under no\n",
      "consideration to expect a personal interview regarding their\n",
      "contributions. They were either to be sent by mail or left at the office\n",
      "until an examination by the proprietor should decide who the fortunate\n",
      "winner of the prize might be.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Ah!\" he began, \"I understand you desire to leave the specimens of your\n",
      "work with me.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Virgie flushed, for his tone was rather frigid. Then she recovered\n",
      "herself, and her face lighted with her rare, beautiful smile, which went\n",
      "directly to the publisher's heart.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, sir,\" she answered, laying a package upon his desk. \"Of course I\n",
      "understand that I am not to expect a private examination of my work. I had\n",
      "no intention of annoying you with the matter. I am willing to take my\n",
      "chance with others. But there is another matter upon which I would like to\n",
      "consult with you if you can spare me a little time.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "She now drew forth a more bulky package from her bag.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Some manuscript, perhaps, which you would like examined?\" responded the\n",
      "gentleman, glancing at it, but speaking indifferently.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, not manuscript according to the common acceptation of the term; and\n",
      "yet, in reality, I suppose it is.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Can you not leave it with me? I will look at it with pleasure later;\" but\n",
      "his tone was not very encouraging.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I should prefer not to do so, because there is not very much time between\n",
      "now and Christmas, and if you do not approve of it I shall like to take it\n",
      "elsewhere,\" Virgie replied, untying the dainty ribbon which bound her\n",
      "package, and, removing the wrapper, she laid before him a little book\n",
      "about eight inches square and comprising some twenty or thirty pages.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was composed of half sheets of the heaviest and nicest of unruled\n",
      "paper, tied together in three places with beautiful little cords and\n",
      "tassels of pale-blue silk.\n",
      "\n",
      "On the cover, in a lovely design composed of mountain ferns, most\n",
      "exquisitely executed, there was written, in a dainty hand, the\n",
      "title--\"Gleanings from the Heights.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The gentleman uttered a low exclamation of pleasure as his eye fell upon\n",
      "this.\n",
      "\n",
      "His attention was riveted; there was no indifference in his manner now.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Chapter XXIII.\n",
      "\n",
      "A Mysterious Stranger.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Did you do this?\" Mr. Knight, the publisher, asked, looking up after a\n",
      "close examination of the dainty cover.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, sir,\" Virgie answered, with a quiet smile, and, seeing that she had\n",
      "gained her point, that he would not leave it until he had seen the whole,\n",
      "she sat down near him to await his verdict.\n",
      "\n",
      "Page after page was turned and on each there was a lovely group of\n",
      "mountain foliage, flowers, or ferns, all beautifully executed in pen and\n",
      "ink, while underneath the design, or cunningly woven around it, was\n",
      "written, in a dainty hand, some appropriate verse or couplet, quotations\n",
      "from various authors, with now and then a bit of real heart rhyme that had\n",
      "been the outgrowth of Virgie's own sad experiences.\n",
      "\n",
      "Everything, as the title indicated, had been taken from the\n",
      "mountains--from those heights where she had spent the last few years of\n",
      "her life.\n",
      "\n",
      "It had been her custom, after gathering the wild, beautiful things, to\n",
      "carefully arrange them and then copy them upon paper.\n",
      "\n",
      "This amusement had served to pass away many an otherwise tedious hour, and\n",
      "she had a portfolio full of these charming designs, which were likely to\n",
      "prove of great value to her in the future, as we shall see.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Knight took ample time for his examination of her work, so much,\n",
      "indeed, that Virgie began to grow weary and anxious to get back to her\n",
      "little one.\n",
      "\n",
      "But at last the gentleman leaned back in his chair, took off his\n",
      "spectacles, and turned his keen, searching glance full upon his visitor's\n",
      "face.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Madam,\" he said, \"it is not my custom to speak extravagantly upon any\n",
      "subject; but I am bound to admit that this is the finest thing of its kind\n",
      "that it has ever been my privilege to examine.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "A beautiful color sprang into Virgie's cheeks at this high praise. She had\n",
      "known that her work was well done, but she had not expected to be told of\n",
      "it quite so frankly or emphatically.\n",
      "\n",
      "She bowed, and murmured her thanks for his appreciation\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What do you want to do with it?\" Mr. Knight asked.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Get it published as a holiday souvenir, and make it pay me a handsome sum\n",
      "for my trouble,\" Virgie responded, in a business-like tone, and then was\n",
      "half-frightened at her own boldness.\n",
      "\n",
      "The publisher's eyes twinkled with amusement.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What would you consider a handsome sum?\" he inquired.\n",
      "\n",
      "Virgie thought a moment; then she replied:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You have offered one, two, and three hundred dollars as prizes for the\n",
      "simple souvenirs described in your advertisement, and surely a work like\n",
      "this must be worth much more.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Very true; but will you name some price for it? I confess that I should\n",
      "like to take it, if you do not value it <i>too</i> highly.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Virgie was astonished at this.\n",
      "\n",
      "She had not expected to be allowed to name her own price. She had\n",
      "supposed, if her work was approved at all, to receive some moderate offer,\n",
      "which she could accept or decline as she saw fit.\n",
      "\n",
      "But she shrank from setting a value upon her work. It was her first\n",
      "effort, and she had no more idea of its worth, as a work of art, than a\n",
      "child.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Sir,\" she returned, \"I will tell you frankly that I never did anything of\n",
      "the kind before; that is, I have never attempted to <i>dispose</i> of any of my\n",
      "work and I do not know what it ought to bring me. I have been suddenly\n",
      "thrown upon my own resources, and it occurred to me that I might turn my\n",
      "one talent to some account.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Your 'one talent' will prove a very valuable one, if rightly employed,\"\n",
      "interposed the publisher, smiling.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Thank you,\" returned Virgie, flushing again. \"And now, since my little\n",
      "book pleases you, will you kindly make me an offer?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, Miss ---- What shall I call you, please? I like to know the names\n",
      "of people with whom I am dealing,\" Mr. Knight observed, with a\n",
      "business-like air.\n",
      "\n",
      "A sudden shock went over Virgie, making her tingle to her finger-tips at\n",
      "this question.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was the first time that she had been asked to give her name since\n",
      "coming to San Francisco.\n",
      "\n",
      "She had lived so like a recluse that there had been no occasion, and she\n",
      "had never decided what she would be called. She could not use her\n",
      "husband's name.\n",
      "\n",
      "If she had more time to think she might have answered the publisher\n",
      "differently; but, as it was, she said, hastily, and not without some\n",
      "confusion:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"My name is Mrs.--Alexander.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Knight started slightly, and threw a searching glance at her.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Alexander! Ah, I used to know--But, pardon me; I was about to make you an\n",
      "offer, I believe.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He seemed to consider a moment, then continued:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I will give you five hundred dollars for this little work, just as it\n",
      "stands, and if it proves to be a success after it is published, I will add\n",
      "ten per cent, of the sales to that amount.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Virgie could scarcely credit her hearing at this generous offer.\n",
      "\n",
      "She had never dreamed of anything like it, and bright visions of future\n",
      "prosperity for herself and her child, attained through her own efforts,\n",
      "alone, flitted through her mind.\n",
      "\n",
      "But she did not lose her self-possession or betray her excessive delight\n",
      "at the unexpected proposal.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What am I to understand by your words, 'if it proves a success?'\" she\n",
      "asked.\n",
      "\n",
      "Again the publisher's eyes twinkled.\n",
      "\n",
      "He knew that she was a novice in dealing with business men, but he saw\n",
      "that she was shrewd and practical, and, finding her talent valuable, meant\n",
      "to make the most of it.\n",
      "\n",
      "He meant, however, to do so well by her that she would be satisfied to\n",
      "give her services exclusively to him.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well,\" he replied, \"if the sales reach a thousand copies I shall consider\n",
      "the book a success.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He knew well enough, if he could get it out in season, he could easily\n",
      "sell three times that number for it was a wonderfully unique and\n",
      "attractive affair.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"More than that,\" he continued, \"if you are pleased to accept my offer, I\n",
      "should like to engage you to prepare two or three designs of a similar\n",
      "character for the Easter trade.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Virgie was not proof against all this good fortune. Her lips trembled, and\n",
      "she was very near breaking down.\n",
      "\n",
      "It seemed almost as if heaven had suddenly opened and sent her a kind\n",
      "friend in the midst of her darkness and trouble.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You are very kind, sir; I feel that you have made me a most liberal\n",
      "offer, and I accept it most gratefully,\" she said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Something in her tone--a sort of hopeless cadence mingling with the\n",
      "gratitude, as if with all this good fortune there were a lurking despair\n",
      "in her heart--touched the gentleman deeply.\n",
      "\n",
      "He was becoming greatly interested in this beautiful woman, who, with that\n",
      "look of heart-broken sadness in her violet eyes, and that grieved droop\n",
      "about her sweet mouth, he believed must have some thrilling history\n",
      "connected with her young life.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Then, Mrs. Alexander, do your best, and give me something especially nice\n",
      "for Easter,\" he returned, brightly, and appearing not to notice her\n",
      "emotion.\n",
      "\n",
      "He arose as he spoke, and took leave of her with a cordial handshake,\n",
      "saying that she would hear from him again soon regarding her other\n",
      "designs, and Virgie went on her homeward way with more of hope and\n",
      "courage than she had known since her great trouble came upon her.\n",
      "\n",
      "She had nearly reached the street where she lived, when something occurred\n",
      "to give her a fearful start.\n",
      "\n",
      "In turning a corner she suddenly came face to face with a man who was\n",
      "wrapped in a heavy circular cape, its collar turned up close about his\n",
      "face and concealing the whole lower portion of it. He wore a wide-brimmed\n",
      "hat that was drawn down over his brow, so that, with the collar and hat\n",
      "together, scarcely anything of his countenance was visible save a pair of\n",
      "piercing black eyes, and a long, sharp nose.\n",
      "\n",
      "As Virgie met those eyes, which were fixed upon her with an eager,\n",
      "questioning look, she had difficulty in repressing a scream of fear and\n",
      "surprise.\n",
      "\n",
      "The next moment, however, she recovered herself, and passed him as if he\n",
      "had been an utter stranger; but, though outwardly calm and indifferent,\n",
      "she was trembling in every limb, while a sense of weakness caused by the\n",
      "shock she had received, made it seem as if she could not go on her way.\n",
      "\n",
      "But she knew it would not do for her to stop, for a sidelong glance over\n",
      "her shoulder and the sound of a step behind her told her that the muffled\n",
      "figure was following her, evidently with the intention of accosting her.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"How dare he come back here? It cannot be that he knows me after all these\n",
      "years,\" she said to herself as she quickened her pace and sped on toward\n",
      "her home.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then a sudden thought smote her.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"He must not know where I live, if it <i>is</i> he, and I am sure I cannot be\n",
      "mistaken, for those eyes are like no others in the world. What shall I\n",
      "do?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "She was rapidly nearing her own door, but a sudden purpose impelled her\n",
      "to keep on and go straight by, without even a pause or a look that way.\n",
      "\n",
      "A block or two beyond she came to a store where she sometimes went to\n",
      "purchase articles that she needed She entered, and going to a counter,\n",
      "called for the first thing she could think of, but kept her eye on the\n",
      "door to see if the man had followed her.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, there could be no doubt that her steps were dogged, for the man\n",
      "passed even as she looked.\n",
      "\n",
      "His keen glance searched her out immediately; then he paused, turned, and\n",
      "walked slowly back.\n",
      "\n",
      "The store was on a corner, and there were two entrances to it--one on the\n",
      "front, one at the side.\n",
      "\n",
      "Virgie paid for her purchase, then worked her way around, going from\n",
      "counter to counter, until she reached the side entrance, when she went\n",
      "slyly out, waited until she saw a car approaching, hailed it, and in\n",
      "another moment went rolling down the street, believing that she had eluded\n",
      "the keen eyes that were on the watch for her.\n",
      "\n",
      "Not so, however; for the man, having heard the car stop, darted around the\n",
      "corner, and espied her in it just as it was about turning into another\n",
      "street.\n",
      "\n",
      "He could not overtake it, and with a muttered expression of annoyance, he\n",
      "was obliged to wait for the next one. But he saw no more of Virgie that\n",
      "day, for she took a transfer, and when about a mile from her home changed\n",
      "cars and at length reached her own door, confident that she had escaped\n",
      "her pursuer for that time.\n",
      "\n",

      "into the hands of a competent lawyer, recommended by Mr. Knight, to whom\n",
      "she had confided something of her history, and solicited his advice\n",
      "regarding the matter.\n",

      "He had advised her not to take any legal proceedings until she had tried\n",

      "\"A mistake!\" repeated Virgie, scornfully, her eyes blazing with\n",

      "\n",
      "\"I wrote him letter after letter while I was in New York. Mrs. Farnum, of\n",
      "whom I have told you, knew the whole family, and wrote of me to Lady\n",
      "Linton, but they appeared to be in total ignorance of even my existence,\n",
      "while Mrs. Farnum asserted that Sir William had been engaged for years to\n",
      "Miss Stanhope, and I have already told you of his subsequent marriage with\n",
      "her.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Still I cannot comprehend how he should dare to commit such a wrong,\"\n",
      "persisted Mr. Knight. \"He must have known that his marriage with you was\n",
      "legal, according to the laws of the State in which it occurred, and the\n",
      "mere fact of his leaving the country could not annul it. If he had assumed\n",
      "a name while he was here, it would not seem so inexplicable, but all the\n",
      "papers which you hold go to show that he married you under his own name\n",
      "and title; while your description of the character of the man makes it\n",
      "seem utterly impossible that he should be guilty of such conduct.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"True. When I think of that, I am heart-broken,\" said Virgie, breaking\n",
      "down for a moment. \"He seemed so true and noble in every respect, and he\n",
      "was particular to have his title appear in the certificate, although he\n",
      "did not adopt it while traveling because he found he was less conspicuous\n",
      "as plain Mr. Heath.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It almost seems to me as if some plot had been laid to separate you,\"\n",
      "said Mr. Knight, thoughtfully.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Impossible! How could such a thing be?\" queried Virgie, skeptically. \"Who\n",
      "would plot against us?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Your letters on both sides may have been intercepted by some enemy with\n",
      "that end in view.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"He has no enemy that I am aware of; neither have I. I did not know a\n",
      "single individual when I went to New York, so there was no one there who\n",
      "would be likely to meddle with our correspondence. More than this, if he\n",
      "did not hear from me, and was true to me, or had possessed an atom of\n",
      "affection for his child, it is but natural to suppose that he would have\n",
      "taken prompt measures to ascertain what the trouble was. No; the more I\n",
      "dwell upon it, the more I am convinced that what he has done was a scheme\n",
      "to secure my property, and then leave me to my fate. I can think of no\n",
      "other object that he could have had.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Alas! Virgie realized long after how she had wronged a noble man with\n",
      "these dreadful suspicions, and even while she was giving utterance to\n",
      "them, her heart was heavy with a sense of injustice done the man whom,\n",
      "even then, she loved most fondly.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Knight shook his head in a doubtful manner at her last words, and yet\n",
      "he looked perplexed.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You think I am too hard,\" Virgie continued, bitterly \"but does not even\n",
      "the provision which he made for me before leaving New York look as if he\n",
      "did not intend to return to me?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You refer to the five thousand dollars which he deposited for you; it was\n",
      "a very generous amount, truly.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Of course I could not begin to use such a sum in the few weeks that he\n",
      "pretended he should be away; while the additional five hundred dollars\n",
      "which he sent me through his sister goes to prove that he had no intention\n",
      "of ever coming back to me, yet did not wish me to suffer for lack of\n",
      "means.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I do not like the aspect of that transaction at all,\" responded Mr.\n",
      "Knight, emphatically. \"It looks to me as if his sister had had more to do\n",
      "with the matter than rightly belonged to her. Who knows but what she may\n",
      "have been opposed to her brother's marriage and has been at the bottom of\n",
      "all the trouble?\" he concluded, reasoning with a shrewdness which he did\n",
      "not realize.\n",
      "\n",
      "But Virgie could not be convinced.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I do not believe that,\" she said, with a sigh; \"it looks to me as if he\n",
      "was ashamed--conscience-smitten--and did not have the moral courage to\n",
      "communicate with me himself.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Yet, even as she said it, she knew that such a course was utterly at\n",
      "variance with his character, as she had known it.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, Mrs. Alexander--or Mrs. Heath, I suppose I ought to call you--I\n",
      "will not say more to dissuade you from your purpose; but let me advise\n",
      "you, as a sincere friend, to go to England and ascertain for yourself just\n",
      "how matters are, before you proceed any further.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Virgie started to her feet, with crimson cheeks and flashing eyes.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Go to England!--to Heathdale! to find another woman queening it there in\n",
      "<i>my</i> place!--to be brow-beaten and insulted by that proud family!--to be\n",
      "disowned by the man who has already wronged me beyond all forgiveness!\n",
      "Never, sir!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You could at least demand your own--the money that your father left you.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And do you suppose I should get it? I have no proof that my father ever\n",
      "left me a dollar. Sir William has every paper in his own possession. I\n",
      "have not a scrap even that would enable me to wrest so much as a pound\n",
      "from him as my right.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Knight looked grave. Certainly matters were not very promising for the\n",
      "injured wife.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, it is the most incomprehensible affair that I ever heard of,\" he\n",
      "said. \"I still think, though, that a personal interview would be the wiser\n",
      "course before proceeding further. However, a proper notice will have to be\n",
      "served upon the man, and if there has been any misunderstanding, or he has\n",
      "any desire to contest your appeal for a divorce, he will probably make it\n",
      "apparent when the right time comes. And now, regarding the best counsel\n",
      "for you, I think my friend, Templeton would work well for you, and secure\n",
      "a bill with as little notoriety as any one.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Virgie shivered at this business-like talk of \"a bill.\" It was almost like\n",
      "severing soul from body to break the sacred tie that bound her to the man\n",
      "she so fondly loved, and nothing save the belief that another was\n",
      "occupying the place that rightly belonged to her could have induced her to\n",
      "take such a step.\n",
      "\n",
      "She applied to Mr. Templeton, as Mr. Knight advised He, too, counseled\n",
      "further intercourse with the baronet, for, to his keen mind, also, the\n",
      "whole affair appeared more like a conspiracy on the part of enemies than a\n",
      "willful wrong perpetrated by the husband.\n",
      "\n",
      "But Virgie utterly refused to hold any communication with Sir William.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"He will have to be notified regarding the proceedings about to be\n",
      "instituted against him,\" she said, \"and if he is guiltless of wrong he\n",
      "will surely hasten to make it apparent.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "In spite of her obstinate refusal to make further overtures, something of\n",
      "hope had been revived in her heart by the united opinions of Mr. Knight\n",
      "and her lawyer that some enemy had plotted to separate her from her\n",
      "husband. She remembered what Mrs. Farnum had told her about the pride of\n",
      "his family, and it might be there was some foundation for the belief of\n",
      "the two gentlemen. She could understand how that might possibly be the\n",
      "case as far as intercepting their letters was concerned, but those other\n",
      "facts of the long engagement and the marriage with Miss Stanhope were\n",
      "things which she could not explain by any reasoning.\n",
      "\n",
      "Still she kept hoping for some word during the time that intervened\n",
      "between the notification and the day set for the hearing of the case. Day\n",
      "after day she waited and watched for some tidings from her husband\n",
      "starting at every unusual sound, growing almost faint at the opening and\n",
      "shutting of a door, and even imagining she saw a familiar form as she sat\n",
      "at her window and eagerly scanned every passer-by.\n",
      "\n",
      "She grew thin and pale with this dreadful suspense; she seemed to be\n",
      "consuming with fever, and was so restless and nervous that her friend, Mr.\n",
      "Knight, feared that her mind might suffer from such tension.\n",
      "\n",
      "She hoped until the last moment, although she tried to conceal it, but\n",
      "when the dreaded day arrived, when her case was presented and there was\n",
      "no one to contest it; when the judge rendered his decision, declaring that\n",
      "her marriage was null and void, that henceforth in the eyes of the law and\n",
      "the world she was free from the man to whom she had solemnly promised to\n",
      "cling until death should part them, her courage and strength forsook her,\n",
      "and she was carried lifeless from the court-room, while for three weeks\n",
      "afterward she lay weak and ill, and almost indifferent to life.\n",
      "\n",
      "The only grain of comfort in this time of woe was derived from the fact\n",
      "that the child had been given to her, and she had no fear of ever having\n",
      "it taken from her, even if Sir William should ever be moved to a desire to\n",
      "have her.\n",
      "\n",
      "For a time she seemed wholly unlike herself; but the kind-hearted\n",
      "publisher knew that the best antidote for all kinds of trouble is work,\n",
      "and he kept her crowded with orders, until she felt obliged to rally her\n",
      "failing energies and to take up the burdens of life once more.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thus the winter passed; but, when summer came again, little Virgie began\n",
      "to droop in the noisome atmosphere of the city, and the physician said she\n",
      "must be taken where she could have purer air and country living; so Virgie\n",
      "went to a quiet little place a few miles out of the city, where she\n",
      "remained the entire season, not returning to San Francisco until late in\n",
      "October, and thus a cruel fate again seemed to mock her, for during her\n",

      "as we know, she had gone into the country on little Virgie's account,\n",
      "while Mr. Knight was away on a trip to British Columbia, or he might have\n",
      "seen Sir William's advertisements, and helped him in the matter so near,\n",
      "his heart.\n",
      "\n",
      "About the middle of October he decided to go once more to her old home\n",
      "among the mountains of Nevada, hoping to learn something of her there.\n",
      "\n",
      "But, of course, he did not, and he finally came to the conclusion that she\n",
      "must have left California after obtaining her divorce. At least he thought\n",
      "she would leave San Francisco, for he knew that there were unpleasant\n",
      "associations connected with her past life there, and he did not believe\n",
      "she would like to make her home in that city, where disagreeable rumors\n",
      "might still exist. But, still resolving to find her at any cost, he turned\n",
      "his face in another direction, and began anew his wanderings up and down\n",
      "the land.\n",
      "\n",
      "Three weary years he spent thus, following every clew, but all to no\n",
      "purpose. Then, saddened and disheartened he was compelled to give up the\n",

      "Mrs. Farnum and her daughter were full of hope, after learning that the\n",

      "last succeed in securing the prize she had so long coveted.\n",
      "\n",
      "Every art was made use of to captivate the wealthy baronet, but it was\n",
      "evident that his heart was irrevocably fixed--that he had no intention of\n",
      "ever marrying again. Finally the disappointed girl gave her hand to a\n",
      "rich, but aged and feeble lord, and tried to satisfy her heart and\n",
      "ambition with the golden husks thus achieved.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Farnum lost her husband soon after her return from America, and\n",
      "afterward made her home mostly with her daughter. But she was far from\n",
      "being a happy woman, even though she had everything which unlimited wealth\n",
      "could purchase. Her conscience never ceased to trouble her for the part\n",
      "she had played in helping to ruin the life of that beautiful wife and\n",
      "mother whom she had met in New York. She was ever haunted by that sad,\n",
      "sweet face. She had been half-tempted, many times, to confess everything\n",
      "to Sir William, hoping thus to atone in part for what she had done, and\n",
      "because, after she found that Sadie's cause was hopeless, she began to\n",
      "pity that poor, injured girl; but her fear of Lady Linton, and also of Sir\n",
      "William's righteous anger, prevented her doing so.\n",

      "Thus five years passed.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was now ten years since Sir William Heath's marriage with Virgie, but\n",

      "the time of his death was serving on an important appointment abroad.\n",
      "\n",
      "During this service he had acquired many honors and great wealth. His wife\n",
      "was the second daughter of Lord Shaftonsberry, but she had lived only one\n",
      "short month after the birth of their only son, Rupert, who was now to\n",
      "become the ward of Sir William Heath.\n",
      "\n",
      "He was a noble little fellow, and it was not long before the baronet\n",
      "became fondly attached to him, and believed that perhaps he had at last\n",
      "found, in rearing this child of promise to manhood, something that would\n",
      "add interest and zest to his dreary and monotonous life.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lady Linton, who was still at Heathdale, and nominally its mistress,\n",
      "received the orphaned stranger with great kindness.\n",

      "He was heir presumptive to the title and estates of Shaftonsberry, if\n",
      "death should remove the present incumbent who as yet had no children of\n",
      "his own, and this circumstance, in addition to the great wealth which\n",
      "young Rupert inherited from his father, made him a person of considerable\n",
      "consequence.\n",
      "\n",
      "Her ladyship's mind, with its habitual cunning, leaped forward eight or\n",
      "ten years, and planned a union of the houses of Linton and Shaftonsberry,\n",
      "by the marriage of her daughter, Lillian, now eleven years of age, with\n",
      "her brother's ward.\n",
      "\n",
      "She argued that everything was in her favor for accomplishing this, for\n",
      "the children would be reared beneath the same roof, and it would be\n",
      "comparatively easy to educate them to consider themselves destined for\n",
      "each other.\n",
      "\n",
      "Of course this arch plotter kept all this to herself, for she well knew\n",
      "that her brother would sternly oppose all match-making of this sort; but\n",

      "\n",
      "Virgie entered upon her work with renewed interest, although she had not\n",
      "been idle during the summer by any means. With her pen she had copied\n",
      "nature in every possible phase, and had brought home, for her winter's\n",

      "\n",
      "She had for some time been engaged upon quite an extensive work, which was\n",
      "to be elegantly bound, and which promised to be something very rare and\n",
      "unique.\n",
      "\n",
      "She threw herself into this with such energy, after her return, and worked\n",
      "at it so steadily and with so much enthusiasm, that Mr. Knight really\n",
      "began to fear that she would overtax her strength.\n",
      "\n",
      "From the first he had been deeply interested in the beautiful and talented\n",
      "woman who bore her sorrows so bravely and battled so courageously with the\n",
      "adverse fate that had well-nigh ruined her life. He had pitied her\n",
      "friendlessness, and tried to throw around her a sort of fatherly care and\n",
      "protection; but as he came to know her better, to realize her strength of\n",
      "mind and character, and beauty of disposition, a warmer feeling began to\n",
      "take the place of pity and compassion, until, as she grew to confide in\n",
      "and rely upon him more and more, the hope that he might perhaps win her to\n",
      "share and brighten his lonely home during the declining years of his life,\n",
      "gradually dawned upon him, and he finally resolved to ask her to become\n",
      "his wife.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I could save her from all this toil, and all uncertainty about the\n",
      "future. I would ask no greater happiness than to see her mistress of my\n",

      "have all my wealth to smooth her own future.\"\n",
      "\n",

      "yourself so closely--there is no need.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No need?\" returned Virgie; \"there is every need. I am very mercenary, Mr.\n",
      "Knight,\" she added, smiling \"I am determined to make all the money I can,\n",
      "so that my dear little girl may have every advantage by and by.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But if you tax your strength too severely you may break down, and that\n",

      "\n",
      "\"I do not think I am going beyond my strength,\" Virgie replied, gravely.\n",
      "\"Besides, I am much more content when I am very busy; it keeps me\n",
      "from--thinking.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You ought to be far more than simply 'content,'\" answered Mr. Knight,\n",
      "regarding the fair face wistfully, \"for you are not only making plenty of\n",
      "money, but winning fame for yourself also. The name of Alexander bids fair\n",
      "to become renowned.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Virgie started violently at this, and glanced sharply at her companion.\n",

      "countenance. Then light seemed to dawn upon him suddenly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Pardon me,\" he said, leaning eagerly toward her, \"but what you have said\n",
      "has enlightened me regarding something that has puzzled me since the day I\n",
      "first met you. You are the daughter of Abbot Alexander who disappeared so\n",
      "mysteriously from this city several years ago.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, it is true,\" Virgie confessed, with bowed head and burning cheeks.\n",
      "\"But, oh, Mr. Knight, pray do not allow any one else to suspect my\n",
      "identity if you can avoid it. Put some other name to my books, or put no\n",
      "name at all to them. For my father's sake, I shrink from attracting public\n",
      "attention to his name.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"My dear young friend, I fear you are morbidly sensitive I used to know\n",
      "your father, and I always esteemed him as a noble man--one whose honor was\n",
      "unimpeachable.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Ah! Then you do not know--\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, I do know all about that financial earthquake which wrought his ruin\n",
      "and that of many others; but I am sure <i>he</i> was blameless.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You judge him, then, more kindly than others,\" Virgie returned, almost\n",
      "weeping to hear her father so warmly defended. \"There are few, I fear, who\n",
      "do not believe the very worst of him even now.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Doubtless that is true,\" Mr. Knight answered, with a sigh; \"but I have\n",
      "always been convinced that that rascally cashier was at the bottom of the\n",
      "wrong. You must pardon me for speaking so plainly. I know that he was a\n",
      "relative, though unworthy the name he bore.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But all the papers stated that the president and cashier were in league,\"\n",
      "said Virgie.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I know it; and at first the affair did have that appearance--at least,\n",
      "such a construction was but natural under the circumstances.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But papa gave up every dollar he possessed to right the wrong.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I know he did, but the amount was so small, compared with that which had\n",
      "been stolen, that people were skeptical regarding his motives, and when he\n",
      "also disappeared, they were only too ready to believe that he had gone to\n",
      "share the plunder with the guilty cashier. But I would as soon suspect\n",
      "myself of a crime as Abbot Alexander. I <i>know</i> that he was an honorable\n",
      "man.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, it is such a comfort to hear you say this,\" Virgie murmured, her\n",
      "voice husky with emotion, her eyes filled with tears. \"Poor papa! his last\n",
      "years were embittered with the thought that every one believed him a\n",
      "defaulter--that he had not one friend in all the world, save his daughter,\n",
      "who had faith in him.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"He made a great mistake in leaving San Francisco as he did,\" Mr. Knight\n",
      "remarked. \"If he had remained here and quietly lived down the scandal, he\n",
      "might in time have recovered the confidence of the people.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh! if the stain could be removed from his name and memory!\" sighed\n",
      "Virgie.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I do not like to pain you, my dear,\" replied Mr. Knight, sympathetically;\n",
      "\"but that would be very difficult to accomplish, unless that cashier\n",
      "should come forward and make a full confession.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Virgie looked up, startled, her face growing very white.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I saw him here in the city last year,\" she said.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Impossible!\" exclaimed her friend.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I am very sure I was not mistaken,\" Virgie affirmed and then she told the\n",
      "publisher the circumstances of her being followed by that muffled figure\n",
      "and of the advertisement which appeared in the papers a day or two\n",
      "following, desiring communication with her.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I am afraid that <i>you</i> have made a mistake this time,\" said Mr. Knight,\n",
      "thoughtfully. \"You ought to have communicated with the man.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But I had such a horror of him; I could not believe that he would be able\n",
      "to tell me of anything to my advantage.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"At least he could have done you no harm, and he might have told you\n",
      "something worth knowing. Promise me, if anything of the same nature occurs\n",
      "again, you will let me know. If he could be arrested he might be forced to\n",
      "a confession of the truth.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Virgie was greatly disturbed by this view of the matter, and regretted\n",
      "that she had not had more wisdom at the time. She readily promised to do\n",
      "as Mr. Knight wished, though she feared she might never again have the\n",
      "opportunity.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Now that the ice has been broken, and I know who you are, tell me\n",
      "something of your life among the mountains,\" said her friend. \"I fear it\n",
      "must have been a very dreary and monotonous one.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It was a very quiet and peaceful one,\" Virgie answered with a sigh, as\n",
      "she thought of the storms she had buffeted since. \"Papa's claim proved to\n",
      "be an excellent one, and he made a good deal of money from it; and after\n",
      "we became somewhat used to the change in our life, it was not so bad.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But all his earnings there had to be sacrificed also. My poor child; what\n",
      "a hard lot has been yours! I almost wonder at your having any faith\n",
      "whatever in human nature,\" said Mr. Knight, feelingly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I am sure that <i>you</i> have proved to me that there is at least one noble\n",
      "man in the world,\" Virgie returned, gratefully. \"I shall never forget your\n",
      "kindness to me, Mr. Knight; you have been a true friend to me.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The publisher leaned eagerly forward, and gathered her hands in his; her\n",
      "words had inspired him with hope.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Let me be more than a friend to you, dear,\" he pleaded. \"Let me take care\n",
      "of you and your little one in the future. I know that I am much older than\n",
      "you--old enough almost to be your father; but my home is lonely. I lost my\n",
      "wife ten years ago. I have no children, and my heart is hungry for some\n",
      "one to love. Dear child, you have been growing very dear to me ever since\n",
      "you first came to me, and if you can trust me, if you can give yourself to\n",
      "me, I will not ask too much, or even expect that you can feel a great deal\n",
      "of affection for me, for I know how sorely you have been tried and\n",
      "deceived in that respect; but let me persuade you to come to my home as my\n",
      "honored wife, and I will surround you with tenderest care. Life shall be\n",
      "made as pleasant as possible for you, and there will be no need of your\n",
      "toiling any more.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Virgie sat as one stunned after this unexpected proposal.\n",
      "\n",
      "She had never thought of anything like this during all her intercourse\n",
      "with the kind-hearted publisher. She had learned to esteem him very highly\n",
      "for his goodness to her, and to look up to him almost as to a father, but\n",
      "the thought of ever being any man's wife again had never occurred to her.\n",
      "\n",
      "She grew very pale at his words, and instinctively shrank a little from\n",
      "him.\n",
      "\n",
      "That act told him far more than words could have done, and he knew at once\n",
      "that his cause was hopeless.\n",
      "\n",
      "He gently released her hands, sighing regretfully, while a look of pain\n",
      "settled upon his fine face.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh! my friend,\" Virgie began, as soon as she could find her voice, \"why\n",
      "have you said this to me? I have not had the remotest suspicion of--of\n",
      "your regard and what you have asked can never, never be.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Then forget that I have said anything about it, my dear. I would not\n",
      "wound you for the world,\" said the old gentleman, with exceeding\n",
      "gentleness, but with a still pained, white face.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, please do not think me ungrateful for all your kindness,\" Virgie\n",
      "cried, the tears dropping thick and fast from her eyes; \"but, believe me,\n",
      "I can never marry again. I feel, morally speaking, that I am just as truly\n",
      "Sir William Heath's wife to-day as I ever was, even though the law has\n",
      "rent the bond that existed between us. I do not feel that a marriage can\n",
      "be broken except by death.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Then why did you appeal for a divorce?\" interrupted Mr. Knight, with\n",
      "surprise.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Simply that he might be free in the eyes of the world to make that other\n",
      "woman a legal wife--so that she need not suffer such a wrong through me.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But she has already suffered it, if what you have heard is true.\"\n",

      "\n",
      "Gentle, courteous, and _patient_ reader--to understand the above plan,\n",
      "it is requisite that you carry your mind's eye back to those troublous\n",
      "times when men enjoyed no protection, but in opposing force to force;\n",
      "and to a period when _every man's house was his castle_, though not in\n",
      "the metaphorical sense we have since been accustomed to apply these\n",
      "words, viz. to the protection and security of British subjects.\n",
      "\n",
      "Few portions of our island have been more amply illustrated, by\n",
      "antiquarians, than OXFORD; and from one of these we learn that a Keep\n",
      "Tower, or Castle, existed here a considerable time before the conquest;\n",
      "for Alfred lived here; and Harold Harefoot was crowned and resided here;\n",
      "and one of Alfred's sons struck money here. Hearne has likewise\n",
      "identified this fact by the very ancient and original arms of Oxford,\n",
      "which have a castle represented, with a large ditch and bridge. Upon the\n",
      "same authority we learn that Offa \"built walls at Oxford,\" and by him,\n",
      "therefore, a Saxon castle was originally built at Oxford.\n",
      "\n",
      "Leland, Dugdale, and Camden, on the other hand, affirm that the castle\n",
      "at Oxford was built by Robert D'Oiley, who came into England with\n",
      "William the Conqueror; and the Chronicles of Osney Abbey, preserved in\n",
      "the Cottonian library, even ascertain the precise date of this great\n",
      "baron's undertaking, viz. A.D. 1071. No question, therefore, can remain,\n",
      "but that this illustrious chieftain either repaired or rebuilt the\n",
      "castle; but as we have shown, upon equal authority, there was a Saxon\n",
      "castle, fit for a royal residence at Oxford, long previous to D'Oiley's\n",
      "time. About the year 1794, several Saxon remains were discovered here;\n",
      "but our engraving represents the castle in Norman times, with Robert\n",
      "D'Oiley's magnificent additions, and is a facsimile of a plan by Ralph\n",
      "Agas, in 1538, which, allowing a little for bad or unskilful drawing,\n",
      "may be taken as a perfect specimen of Norman military architecture, and\n",
      "will, we are persuaded, be received by our readers as a popular and\n",
      "interesting illustration of the warlike character of the age in which\n",
      "the castle was erected.\n",
      "\n",
      "For the description we are indebted to a MS. account of Anthony Wood, in\n",
      "the Bodleian library, who informs us that at one of its entrances was \"a\n",
      "large bridge, which led into a long and broad entry, and so to the chief\n",
      "gate of the castle, the entry itself being fortified, on each side, with\n",
      "a large embattled wall; and having several passages above, from one side\n",
      "to the other, with open spaces between them, through which, in times of\n",
      "storm, whenever any enemy had broken through the first gates of the\n",
      "bridge, and was gotten into the entry, scalding water or stones might be\n",
      "cast down to annoy them.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "On passing through the gate, at the end of this long entry, the\n",
      "fortification stretched itself, on the left hand, in a straight line,\n",
      "till it came to a _round_ tower, that was rebuilt in the 19th of Henry\n",
      "III.[1] And from thence went a fair embattled wall, guarded for the most\n",
      "part with the mill-stream underneath, till it came to the high tower\n",
      "joining to St. George's church.[2]\n",
      "\n",
      "From hence, says the manuscript, the wall went to another gate, now\n",
      "quite down, opposite to the abovementioned; and leading to Osney, over\n",
      "another bridge; close to which joined that lofty and eminent mount,\n",
      "sometime crowned with an embattled tower. The manuscript adds, that for\n",
      "the greater defence of this castle, there was, on one of the sides of\n",
      "it, _a barbican_; which seems to have not merely been a single tower,\n",
      "but (according to an ancient deed) _a place_, or outwork, containing\n",
      "several habitations; and from other accounts it further appears, that\n",
      "there were more barbicans than one.\n",
      "\n",
      "The ruins of certain other towers of the castle, besides the barbicans,\n",
      "and those already described, are also said to have been standing till\n",
      "1649; when they were pulled down to erect new bulwarks for the\n",
      "parliamentary garrison.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is an abstract of Anthony Wood's manuscript, which agrees with\n",
      "Agas's drawing, except that in his sketch, the tower between the\n",
      "gate-tower and St. George's, is represented square instead of being\n",
      "round. Antiquarians also infer that in the drawing it was intended to\n",
      "represent the great keep-tower as standing upon the top of the mount,\n",
      "and not by the side of it.[3]\n",
      "\n",
      "Some discoveries made in 1794, throw much light on the history of the\n",
      "castle, and warrant a conclusion that in its area were several\n",
      "buildings. Wells were then cleared out, and among the rubbish were found\n",
      "horses' bones, dogs' bones, horse-shoes, and human skeletons; the\n",
      "appearance of the latter is not easily accounted for, unless they were\n",
      "the bodies of malefactors, who had been executed on the gallows placed\n",
      "near the castle, in later ages, that might have been flung in here,\n",
      "instead of being buried under the gibbet. We must however pass over many\n",
      "interesting facts, and content ourselves with a mere reference to the\n",
      "empress Maud being besieged here in 1141, and her miraculous flight with\n",
      "three knights, all escaping the eyes of the besiegers by the brightness\n",
      "of their raiment; Maud having just previously escaped from the castle of\n",
      "the Devizes, as a dead corpse, in a funeral hearse or bier. The reader\n",
      "will not be surprised at the decay of the castle, when he is informed\n",
      "that it was in a dilapidated state in the reign of Edward III.\n",
      "\n",
      "The castle was situate on the west side of the city of Oxford, on the\n",
      "site of the present county gaol. In 1788 little remained except the\n",
      "tower, which was for some time used as the county prison, and part of\n",
      "the old wall could then be traced 10 feet in thickness. In the\n",
      "castle-yard were the remains of the ancient sessions-house, in which, at\n",
      "the _Black Assize_, in 1577, the lieutenant of the county, two knights,\n",
      "eighty esquires and justices, and almost all the grand jury, died of a\n",
      "distemper, brought thither and communicated by the prisoners; and nearly\n",
      "one hundred scholars and townsmen fell victims to the same disorder.\n",
      "\n",
      "We have been somewhat minute in the preceding description, but we hope\n",
      "not more so than the exhaustless curiosity of the public on such\n",
      "subjects appears to warrant. Indeed, these interesting details are only\n",
      "a tithe portion of what we might have abridged. The warlike habits of\n",
      "our ancestors are always attractive topics for inquirers into the\n",
      "history of mankind, and their study is not\n",
      "\n",
      "  Dull and crabbed as some fools suppose,\n",
      "\n",
      "but a treasury or depository of useful knowledge, by enabling the\n",
      "inquirer to draw many valuable inferences from the comparative states of\n",
      "men in the several ages he seeks to illustrate. The enthusiasm of such\n",
      "pursuits is, likewise, an everlasting source of delight; for who can\n",
      "visit such shrines as Netley, St. Albans, or Melrose, without feeling\n",
      "that he is on holy ground; and although we are equally active in our\n",
      "notice of the architectural triumphs of our own times, we must not\n",
      "entirely leave the proud labours of by-gone ages to be clasped in the\n",
      "ponderous folio, or to moulder and lie neglected on the upper shelves of\n",
      "our libraries.\n",
      "\n",
      "We have to acknowledge the loan of the original of the engraving, from a\n",
      "lineal descendant of D'OILEY[4], the founder or repairer of the Castle\n",
      "at Oxford--a name not altogether unknown to our readers.\n",
      "\n",
      "    [1] The sum of 144_l_. 5_s_. was expended in the rebuilding.\n",
      "\n",
      "    [2] By an odd mode of expression in the MS., it should seem as\n",
      "    if this tower itself, or at least some building adjoining it,\n",
      "    was formerly made use of as a _royal residence_, for the words\n",

      "The village of Rieval, constructed out of the wreck of the spacious\n",

      "approaches more to the direction of north and south; so that the choir\n",

      "On the opposite side stands a splendid building, extending in length\n",
      "towards the west one hundred feet, and in breadth thirty; this structure\n",
      "appears to have been the refectory, accompanied by a music gallery.\n",
      "Parallel to this, and in a line with the transept, is another extensive\n",
      "ruin, several feet longer than the refectory, and about the same\n",
      "breadth, which was the dormitory; at the west end of which the walls are\n",
      "ancient, and seem to be coeval with the original abbey.[6] The form and\n",
      "ground plan of this building are the same with the abbey of Whitby;\n",
      "though the latter is not so copious in its dimensions. Several members\n",
      "of the noble families of Ross, Scroop, Maltbys, and Oryby, were interred\n",
      "in the chapter-house and choir here. Aelred, the third abbot of\n",
      "Rievaulx, was a man of great literary qualifications, and this abbey\n",
      "possessed an extensive library, which was destroyed by the Scots, in one\n",
      "of their lawless incursions--when the studious produce of the holy\n",
      "brotherhood, assembled by years of incessant study was committed to the\n",
      "reckless flames--and doubtless amongst the collection were many works of\n",

      "\"northern magician\" had sketched the striking portraiture of the\n",
      "enthusiastic father Eustace, in his \"Monastery.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "After inspecting this interesting edifice, we left its hallowed\n",
      "precincts, and took the hilly path leading to a beautiful terrace, which\n",
      "overlooks the vale; each end of which is decorated with two modern\n",
      "temples, one in the Grecian and the other in the Roman style of\n",

      "hills of barren Hambleton subsiding into the fruitful vale; and nearer,\n",
      "fertile fields intersected with wood and mossy rocks; and immediately\n",

      "describe our route through this wilderness. Sometimes our weary feet\n",
      "were relieved from the rough stones and briars by an intervening lawn;\n",
      "and at others we were entirely shrouded from \"day's garish eye\" by\n",

      "Byland abbey was founded in 1177, by the famous Roger de Mowbray, who\n",
      "amply endowed it, and was buried here. He retired hither after being\n",
      "perplexed and fatigued with useless crusades, and suffering the\n",
      "deprivation of nearly all his property by Henry II. Martin Stapylton,\n",
      "Esq. the present proprietor of Byland, discovered from some ancient\n",
      "manuscripts the precise situation in the ruin, where were deposited the\n",
      "bones of the illustrious chieftain; and after removing these relics of\n",
      "mortality which had been hid for six hundred years, he conveyed them in\n",
      "his carriage to Myton, and interred them in the church-yard. The abbey\n",
      "of Byland is memorable for having given concealment, (though not a\n",
      "sanctuary!) to Edward II. who, when flying from his enemies in the\n",
      "north, in 1322, took shelter here, and was surprised by them when at\n",
      "dinner, narrowly escaping, by the swiftness of his horse, to York; and\n",
      "leaving his money, plate, and privy seal, a booty to the savage and\n",
      "exterminating Scots. Byland abbey has nearly disappeared; the only\n",
      "perfect remains are the west end, a fine specimen of Saxon and Gothic,\n",
      "and a small portion of the choir. The church, its transepts, north and\n",

      "Ledyard was one of the marines who were present at Cook's death, of\n",
      "which he gives an account (as appears from extracts of his journal\n",
      "already mentioned,) somewhat different from that in the authentic\n",
      "narrative of the voyage--and different, also, we must add, from his own\n",
      "private journal, which, at least the portion of it relating to that\n",
      "event, is still in the Admiralty. It must be mentioned in favour of\n",
      "Ledyard's sagacity, that the visit to Nootka Sound suggested to him the\n",
      "commercial advantages to be derived from a trade between the north-west\n",
      "coast of America and China; and the views which he took of this subject\n",
      "very much influenced the succeeding events of his life.\n",
      "\n",
      "Towards the end of December, 1782, we find Ledyard serving on board a\n",
      "king's ship in Long Island Sound, from which he obtained leave of\n",
      "absence to visit his mother; but, either from a sense of duty and\n",
      "honour, which obliged him not to act with the enemies of his country, or\n",
      "from a dislike of the service, he never returned. He had conceived, and\n",
      "now began to endeavour to execute, the grand project of a trading voyage\n",
      "to Nootka; for this purpose he went to New York and Philadelphia, and,\n",
      "after addressing himself to various individuals, he prevailed at last on\n",
      "the Honourable Robert Morris to promise him a ship. The projected\n",
      "voyage, however, was ultimately abandoned.\n",
      "\n",
      "Finding, nevertheless, that they all failed him, and heartily sick of\n",
      "the want of enterprise among his own countrymen, he resolved to try his\n",
      "fortune in Europe. He visited Cadiz, from thence took a passage to\n",
      "Brest, and from Brest to L'Orient, where he was successful in prevailing\n",
      "on some merchants to fit out a ship for his north-west adventure; but\n",
      "this project also failed, and Ledyard became once more the sport of\n",
      "accident.\n",
      "\n",
      "He now proceeded to Paris, where he was received with great kindness by\n",
      "Mr. Jefferson, the American minister, who so highly approved of his\n",
      "favourite scheme of an expedition to the north-west coast, that, we are\n",
      "told by his biographer, the journey of Lewis and Clarke, twenty years\n",
      "afterwards, had its origin in the views which Jefferson received from\n",
      "Ledyard. Here, also, he met with the notorious Paul Jones, who was\n",
      "looking after the proceeds of the prizes which he had taken and carried\n",
      "into the ports of France. This adventurer entered warmly into his views,\n",
      "and undertook to fit out two vessels for the expedition. It was settled\n",
      "that Jones was to command the vessels, and carry the furs to the China\n",
      "market, while Ledyard was to remain behind and collect a fresh cargo\n",
      "ready for their return, after which he meant to perambulate the\n",
      "continent of America, and show his countrymen the path to unbounded\n",
      "wealth. Jones, it seems, was so much taken with the plausibility of a\n",
      "scheme, which presented at once the prospect of adventure, fame, and\n",
      "profit, that he advanced money to Ledyard to purchase a part of the\n",
      "cargo for the outfit; but, being suddenly called away to L'Orient, to\n",
      "look after his prize concerns, his zeal for this grand scheme began to\n",
      "cool, and, in a few months, the whole fabric fell to the ground.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ledyard now felt himself a sort of wandering vagabond, without\n",
      "employment, motive, or means of support; the supplies he had received\n",
      "from Jones had ceased, and he was compelled to become a pensioner on the\n",
      "bounty of the American minister and a few friends. It would appear,\n",
      "however, from some lively letters written by him at Paris, that his flow\n",
      "of spirits did not forsake him.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The two Fitzhughs,\" he says, \"dine with me to-day in my chamber,\n",
      "together with our worthy consul, Barclay, and that lump of universality,\n",
      "colonel Franks. But such a set of moneyless rascals have never appeared,\n",
      "since the epoch of the happy villain Falstaff. I have but five French\n",
      "crowns in the world; Franks has not a sol; and the Fitzhughs cannot get\n",
      "their tobacco money. Every day of my life,\" he continues, \"is a day of\n",
      "expectation, and, consequently, a day of disappointment; whether I shall\n",
      "have a morsel of bread to eat at the end of two months, is as much an\n",
      "uncertainty as it was fourteen months ago, and not more so.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "While in this state of penury he received a visit, the object of which\n",
      "was so creditable to a gentleman still living, and not unknown in the\n",
      "annals of science, that it gives us pleasure to print the story in\n",
      "Ledyard's own words:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Permit me to relate to you an incident. About a fortnight ago, Sir\n",
      "James Hall,[8] an English gentleman, on his way from Paris to Cherbourg,\n",
      "stopped his coach at our door, and came up to my chamber. I was in bed\n",
      "at six o'clock in the morning, but having flung on my _robe de chambre_,\n",
      "I met him at the door of the ante-chamber. I was glad to see him, but\n",
      "surprised. He observed, that he had endeavoured to make up his opinion\n",
      "of me, with as much exactness as possible, and concluded that no kind of\n",
      "visit whatever would surprise me. I could do no otherwise than remark,\n",
      "that his _opinion_ surprised me at least, and the conversation took\n",
      "another turn. In walking across the chamber, he laughingly put his hand\n",
      "on a six livre piece, and a louis d'or that lay on my table, and with a\n",
      "half stifled blush, asked me how I was in the money way. Blushes\n",
      "commonly beget blushes, and I blushed partly because he did, and partly\n",
      "on other accounts. 'If fifteen guineas,' said he, interrupting the\n",
      "answer he had demanded, 'will be of any service to you, there they are,'\n",
      "and he put them on the table. 'I am a traveller myself, and though I\n",
      "have some fortune to support my travels, yet I have been so situated as\n",
      "to want money, which you ought not to do. You have my address in\n",
      "London.' He then wished me a good morning and left me. This gentleman\n",
      "was a total stranger to the situation of my finances, and one that I\n",
      "had, by mere accident, met at an ordinary in Paris.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Ledyard observes, that he had no more idea of receiving money from this\n",
      "gentleman than from Tippoo Saib. \"However,\" he says, \"I took it without\n",
      "any hesitation, and told him, I would be as complaisant to him if ever\n",
      "occasion offered.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "His schemes for a north-west voyage, either for trade or discovery,\n",
      "being now wholly abandoned, he set about planning, as the only remaining\n",
      "expedient, a journey by land through the northern regions of Europe and\n",
      "Asia, then to cross Behring's Straits to the continent of America, to\n",
      "proceed down the coast to a more southern latitude, and to cross the\n",
      "whole of that continent from the western to the eastern shore. The\n",
      "empress of Russia was applied to for her permission and protection, but\n",
      "while waiting for her answer Ledyard received an invitation to London\n",
      "from his eccentric friend, Sir James Hall. He found, on his arrival\n",
      "there, that an English ship was in complete readiness to sail for the\n",
      "Pacific Ocean, in which Sir James had procured him a free passage, and\n",
      "to be put on shore at any spot he might choose on the north-west coast.\n",
      "The amiable baronet, moreover, presented him with twenty guineas, as\n",
      "Ledyard says, _pro bono publico_, and with which he tells us, \"he bought\n",
      "two great dogs, an Indian pipe, and a hatchet.\" In a few days the vessel\n",
      "went down the Thames from Deptford, and Ledyard thought it the happiest\n",
      "moment of his life; but such is the uncertainty of human expectations,\n",
      "while he was indulging in day-dreams of the fame and honour which\n",
      "awaited him, he was once more doomed to suffer the agonies of a\n",
      "disappointment to his hopes, the more severe, as being so near their\n",
      "consummation--the vessel was seized by a custom-house officer, brought\n",
      "back, and exchequered.\n",
      "\n",
      "This was undoubtedly the most severe blow he had yet received; but\n",
      "Ledyard never desponded--no sooner was one of his castles demolished,\n",
      "than he set about building another. \"I shall make the tour of the\n",
      "globe,\" he says, \"from London eastward, on foot.\" To aid him in this\n",
      "object, a subscription was raised by Sir Joseph Banks, Sir James Hall,\n",
      "and some others. By this means he arrived at Hamburgh; whence he writes\n",
      "to colonel Smith:--\"Here I am with ten guineas exactly, and in perfect\n",
      "health. One of my dogs is no more: I lost him in my passage up the river\n",
      "Elbe, in a snow storm: I was out in it forty hours in an open boat.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "At the tavern he went to, he learnt that a Major Langhorn, an American\n",
      "officer, \"a very good kind of a man,\" as his host described him, \"and an\n",
      "odd kind of a man, one who had travelled much, and fond of travelling in\n",
      "his own way,\" had left his baggage behind, which was sent after him to\n",
      "Copenhagen, but that, by some accident, it had never reached him. He had\n",
      "left Hamburgh, the host told him, with one spare shirt, and very few\n",
      "other articles of clothing, and added, that he must necessarily be in\n",
      "distress. This man, thought Ledyard to himself, is just suited to be the\n",
      "companion of my travels. The sympathy was irresistible; besides, he\n",
      "might be in want of money; this was an appeal to his generosity, which\n",
      "was equally irresistible to one who, like Ledyard, had ten guineas in\n",
      "his pocket. \"I will fly to him and lay my little all at his feet: he is\n",
      "my countryman, a gentleman, and a traveller, and Copenhagen is not much\n",
      "out of my way to Petersburgh,\" and, accordingly, in the month of\n",
      "January, 1787, after a long and tedious journey, in the middle of\n",
      "winter, through Sweden and Finland, we find him in Copenhagen, having\n",
      "discovered Langhorn shut up in his room, without being able to stir\n",
      "abroad for want of money and decent clothing. After remaining a\n",
      "fortnight, he made a proposal to the Major to accompany him to St.\n",
      "Petersburgh. \"No: I esteem you, but no man on earth shall travel with me\n",
      "the way I do,\" was the abrupt refusal to the man who had gone out of the\n",
      "way several hundred miles to relieve his wants, and given him his last\n",
      "shilling.\n",
      "\n",
      "The visit being ended, and the amicable partnership dissolved, it became\n",
      "necessary for our traveller to think of raising the supplies for a\n",
      "journey round the Gulf of Bothnia, which was now rendered impassable,\n",
      "the distance being not less than twelve hundred miles, chiefly over\n",
      "trackless snows, in regions thinly peopled, the nights long, and the\n",
      "cold intense; and, after all, gaining only, in the direct route, about\n",
      "fifty miles. A Mr. Thompson accepted his bill on Colonel Smith, for a\n",
      "sum which, he says, \"has saved me from perdition, and will enable me to\n",
      "reach Petersburgh.\" This journey he accomplished within seven weeks; but\n",
      "he writes to Mr. Jefferson, \"I cannot tell you by what means I came, and\n",
      "hardly know by what means I shall quit it.\" Through the influence of\n",
      "Professor Pallas, but more especially by the assistance of a Russian\n",
      "officer, he obtained the passport of the empress, then on her route to\n",
      "the Crimea, in fifteen days. His long and dreary journey having\n",
      "exhausted his money, and worn out his clothes, he drew on Sir Joseph\n",
      "Banks for twenty guineas, which that munificent patron of science and\n",
      "enterprise did not hesitate to pay.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fortunately, a Scotch physician, of the name of Brown, was proceeding in\n",
      "the service of the empress as far as the province of Kolyvan, who\n",
      "offered him a seat in his kabitka, and thus assisted him on his journey\n",
      "for more than three thousand miles. Having reached Irkutsk, he remained\n",
      "there about ten days, and left it in company with lieutenant Laxman, a\n",
      "Swedish officer, to embark on the Lena, at a point one hundred and fifty\n",
      "miles distant from Irkutsk, with the intention of floating down its\n",
      "current to Yakutsk. On his arrival at this place, he waited on the\n",
      "commandant, told him he wished to press forward, with all expedition, to\n",
      "Okotsk before the winter should shut in, that he might secure an early\n",
      "passage in the spring to the American continent. The commandant assured\n",
      "him that such a journey was already impossible; that the\n",
      "governor-general, from whom he had brought letters, ordered him to show\n",
      "all possible kindness and service, \"and the first and best service,\"\n",
      "said he, \"is to beseech you not to attempt to reach Okotsk this winter.\"\n",
      "Ledyard still persisting to proceed, a trader was brought in, who, in\n",
      "like manner, declared the journey utterly impracticable.\n",
      "\n",
      "While thus detained for the winter at Yakutsk, he drew up some very just\n",
      "observations on the Tartars, which were afterwards published.\n",
      "\n",
      "He had not remained long at Yakutsk, when Captain Billings returned from\n",
      "the Kolyma. This officer had attended the astronomer Bayley, as his\n",
      "assistant, on the last voyage of Cook, and was, of course, well known to\n",
      "Ledyard. Being on his journey to Irkutsk, he invited Ledyard to\n",
      "accompany him thither. They travelled in sledges up the Lena, and\n",
      "reached Irkutsk in seventeen days, being a distance of fifteen hundred\n",
      "miles. Scarcely, however, had he arrived at this place when he was put\n",
      "under arrest, by an order from the empress. He now experienced no more\n",
      "of that concern for his welfare on the part of the commandant, and even\n",
      "Billings kept away from him. All he could learn was, that he was\n",
      "considered as a French spy, which Billings could at once have\n",
      "contradicted. His state of suspense was very short, as, on the same day,\n",
      "he was sent off in a kabitka, with two guards, one on each side.\n",
      "\n",
      "In this manner was our traveller conveyed to the frontiers of Poland, a\n",
      "distance of six thousand versts, in six weeks. \"Thank heaven,\" says he,\n",
      "as he approached Poland, \"petticoats appear, and the glimmerings of\n",
      "other features. Women are the sure harbingers of an alteration in\n",
      "manners, in approaching a country where their influence is felt.\" He has\n",
      "bestowed, indeed, a beautiful and touching tribute to the excellence of\n",
      "the female character, not more beautiful than just, which cannot be too\n",
      "often recorded in print.\n",
      "\n",
      "On setting our traveller down in Poland, the soldiers who had guarded\n",
      "him, gave him to understand that he might then go where he pleased; but\n",
      "that, if he again returned to the dominions of the empress, he would\n",
      "certainly be hanged. It did not appear for some time what the real cause\n",
      "was of this proceeding; but there is every reason to believe it arose\n",
      "out of the jealousy of the North-west Russian Fur Company, whose\n",
      "head-quarters were at Irkutsk, and that their influence at Petersburgh\n",
      "had procured from the empress the annulment of her previous order,\n",
      "together with the present inhuman mandate. Ledyard, however, knew\n",
      "nothing of this; and, having neither relish nor motive for making the\n",
      "experiment a second time, he took the shortest route to Konigsberg,\n",
      "where he found himself destitute, without friends or means, his hopes\n",
      "blasted, and his health enfeebled. In this forlorn condition, he\n",
      "bethought himself once more of the benevolence of Sir Joseph Banks, and\n",
      "had the good luck to raise five guineas, by a draft on his old\n",
      "benefactor, with which he reached London. Here he was kindly received by\n",
      "Sir Joseph Banks, who gave him an introduction to Mr. Beaufoy, the\n",
      "secretary of a newly-formed association for promoting discoveries in\n",
      "Africa.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Before,\" says Mr. Beaufoy, \"I had learnt from the note the name and\n",
      "business of my visitor, I was struck with the manliness of his person,\n",
      "the breadth of his chest, the openness of his countenance and the\n",
      "inquietude of his eye. I spread the map of Africa before him, and\n",
      "tracing a line from Cairo to Sennaar, and from thence westward in the\n",
      "latitude and supposed direction of the Niger, I told him, that was the\n",
      "route, by which I was anxious that Africa might, if possible, be\n",
      "explored. He said, he should think himself singularly fortunate to be\n",
      "trusted with the adventure. I asked him when he would set out.\n",
      "'To-morrow morning,' was his answer. I told him I was afraid that we\n",
      "should not be able, in so short a time, to prepare his instructions, and\n",
      "to procure for him the letters that were requisite; but that if the\n",
      "committee should approve of his proposal, all expedition should be\n",
      "used.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "In a few weeks all was ready for his departure. The plan was, to proceed\n",
      "up the Nile as far as Sennaar or the Babr-el-Abiad, and from thence to\n",
      "strike across the African continent to the coast of the Atlantic.\n",
      "\n",
      "His letters from Cairo are full of interest. Of the Nile itself he\n",
      "speaks contemptuously, says it resembles the Connecticut in size, or may\n",
      "be compared with the Thames.\n",
      "\n",
      "After some delay, the day is fixed on which the caravan is to leave\n",
      "Cairo. He writes to his friends and to the African Association in great\n",
      "spirits; talks of cutting the continent across, and raises the\n",
      "expectations of his employers to a high pitch;--the very next letters\n",
      "from Cairo brought the melancholy intelligence of his death. It seems he\n",
      "was seized with a bilious complaint, for which he administered a strong\n",
      "solution of vitriolic acid, so powerful as to produce violent and\n",
      "burning pains, that threatened to be fatal unless immediate relief could\n",
      "be procured, which was attempted to be got by a powerful dose of tartar\n",
      "emetic. His death happened about the end of December, 1788, in the\n",
      "thirty-eighth year of his age.\n",
